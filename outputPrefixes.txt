It 67
is 124
a 6799
truth 7
universally 1
acknowledged 1
that 11
a 6799
single 15
man 343
in 2719
possession 3
of 109
a 6799
good 29
fortune 8
must 28
be 1200
in 2719
want 13
of 109
a 6799
wife 6
However 1
little 6
known 1
the 193
feelings 1
or 333
views 1
of 109
such 2
a 6799
man 343
may 49
be 1200
on 86
his 43
first 8
entering 1
a 6799
this 6
truth 7
is 124
so 797
well 24
fixed 2
in 2719
the 193
minds 4
of 109
the 193
surrounding 4
families 1
that 11
he 962
is 124
considered 1
the 193
rightful 4
property 2
of 109
some 30
one 19
or 333
other 5
of 109
their 2
daughters 1
My 90
dear 15
Mr 5
Bennet 1
said 1
his 43
lady 18
to 806
him 9
one 19
day 27
have 11
you 29
heard 1
that 11
Park 18
is 124
let 50
at 272
last 7
Mr 5
Bennet 1
replied 1
that 11
he 962
had 11
not 85
But 82
it 67
is 124
returned 1
she 199
for 484
Mrs 1
Long 49
has 41
just 24
been 1
here 31
and 51
she 199
told 1
me 1041
all 162
about 1
it 67
Mr 5
Bennet 1
made 13
no 896
answer 8
Do 814
you 29
not 85
want 13
to 806
know 12
who 79
has 41
taken 1
it 67
cried 1
his 43
wife 6
impatiently 1
_You_ 1
want 13
to 806
tell 16
me 1041
and 51
I 4330
have 11
no 896
objection 5
to 806
hearing 3
it 67
This 6
was 93
invitation 6
enough 2
Why 4
my 90
dear 15
you 29
must 28
know 12
Mrs 1
Long 49
says 1
that 11
is 124
taken 1
by 57
a 6799
young 9
man 343
of 109
large 11
fortune 8
from 2
the 193
north 42
of 109
England 2
that 11
he 962
came 36
down 90
on 86
Monday 3
in 2719
a 6799
chaise 3
and 51
four 26
to 806
see 70
the 193
place 29
and 51
was 93
so 797
much 2
delighted 2
with 34
it 67
that 11
he 962
agreed 1
with 34
Mr 5
Morris 2
immediately 1
that 11
he 962
is 124
to 806
take 18
possession 3
before 2
Michaelmas 3
and 51
some 30
of 109
his 43
servants 1
are 12
to 806
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
house 87
by 57
the 193
end 92
of 109
next 2
week 20
What 14
is 124
his 43
name 17
Is 124
he 962
married 3
or 333
single 15
Oh 17
Single 15
my 90
dear 15
to 806
be 1200
sure 11
A 6799
single 15
man 343
of 109
large 11
fortune 8
four 26
or 333
five 5
thousand 7
a 6799
year 19
What 14
a 6799
fine 17
thing 15
for 484
our 3
girls 1
How 27
so 797
How 27
can 287
it 67
affect 15
them 9
My 90
dear 15
Mr 5
Bennet 1
replied 1
his 43
wife 6
how 27
can 287
you 29
be 1200
so 797
tiresome 4
You 29
must 28
know 12
that 11
I 4330
am 392
thinking 2
of 109
his 43
marrying 1
one 19
of 109
them 9
Is 124
that 11
his 43
design 16
in 2719
settling 1
here 31
Design 16
Nonsense 2
how 27
can 287
you 29
talk 18
so 797
But 82
it 67
is 124
very 1
likely 1
that 11
he 962
_may_ 1
fall 29
in 2719
love 29
with 34
one 19
of 109
them 9
and 51
therefore 1
you 29
must 28
visit 14
him 9
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 962
comes 4
I 4330
see 70
no 896
occasion 7
for 484
that 11
You 29
and 51
the 193
girls 1
may 49
go 501
or 333
you 29
may 49
send 10
them 9
by 57
themselves 1
which 2
perhaps 1
will 39
be 1200
still 13
better 7
for 484
as 509
you 29
are 12
as 509
handsome 6
as 509
any 17
of 109
them 9
Mr 5
may 49
like 22
you 29
the 193
best 37
of 109
the 193
party 3
My 90
dear 15
you 29
flatter 10
me 1041
I 4330
certainly 1
_have_ 1
had 11
my 90
share 22
of 109
beauty 2
but 82
I 4330
do 814
not 85
pretend 7
to 806
be 1200
anything 3
extraordinary 1
now 10
When 6
a 6799
woman 21
has 41
five 5
grown-up 1
daughters 1
she 199
ought 2
to 806
give 15
over 596
thinking 2
of 109
her 181
own 9
beauty 2
In 2719
such 2
cases 1
a 6799
woman 21
has 41
not 85
often 4
much 2
beauty 2
to 806
think 8
of 109
But 82
my 90
dear 15
you 29
must 28
indeed 1
go 501
and 51
see 70
Mr 5
when 6
he 962
comes 4
into 26
the 193
It 67
is 124
more 11
than 22
I 4330
engage 6
for 484
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
But 82
consider 13
your 4
daughters 1
Only 1
think 8
what 14
an 970
establishment 3
it 67
would 5
be 1200
for 484
one 19
of 109
them 9
Sir 22
William 3
and 51
Lady 18
Lucas 1
are 12
determined 2
to 806
go 501
merely 1
on 86
that 11
account 14
for 484
in 2719
general 22
you 29
know 12
they 5
visit 14
no 896
newcomers 1
Indeed 1
you 29
must 28
go 501
for 484
it 67
will 39
be 1200
impossible 2
for 484
_us_ 1
to 806
visit 14
him 9
if 8
you 29
do 814
not 85
You 29
are 12
surely 1
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
Mr 5
will 39
be 1200
very 1
glad 30
to 806
see 70
you 29
and 51
I 4330
will 39
send 10
a 6799
few 6
lines 4
by 57
you 29
to 806
assure 6
him 9
of 109
my 90
hearty 2
consent 5
to 806
his 43
marrying 1
whichever 1
he 962
chooses 1
of 109
the 193
girls 1
though 12
I 4330
must 28
throw 14
in 2719
a 6799
good 29
word 26
for 484
my 90
little 6
Lizzy 2
I 4330
desire 6
you 29
will 39
do 814
no 896
such 2
thing 15
Lizzy 2
is 124
not 85
a 6799
bit 48
better 7
than 22
the 193
others 1
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
is 124
not 85
half 23
so 797
handsome 6
as 509
Jane 8
nor 102
half 23
so 797
good-humoured 1
as 509
Lydia 4
But 82
you 29
are 12
always 1
giving 2
the 193
preference 3
They 5
have 11
none 32
of 109
them 9
much 2
to 806
recommend 8
them 9
replied 1
he 962
they 5
are 12
all 162
silly 2
and 51
ignorant 2
like 22
other 5
girls 1
but 82
Lizzy 2
has 41
something 3
more 11
of 109
quickness 2
than 22
her 181
sisters 1
Mr 5
Bennet 1
how 27
can 287
you 29
abuse 7
your 4
own 9
children 1
in 2719
such 2
a 6799
way 27
You 29
take 18
delight 8
in 2719
vexing 1
me 1041
You 29
have 11
no 896
compassion 4
for 484
my 90
poor 11
nerves 1
You 29
mistake 5
me 1041
my 90
dear 15
I 4330
have 11
a 6799
high 54
respect 18
for 484
your 4
nerves 1
They 5
are 12
my 90
old 21
friends 4
I 4330
have 11
heard 1
you 29
mention 5
them 9
with 34
consideration 3
these 4
last 7
twenty 2
years 1
at 272
least 3
Ah 17
you 29
do 814
not 85
know 12
what 14
I 4330
suffer 11
But 82
I 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
get 13
over 596
it 67
and 51
live 43
to 806
see 70
many 2
young 9
men 140
of 109
four 26
thousand 7
a 6799
year 19
come 36
into 26
the 193
It 67
will 39
be 1200
no 896
use 18
to 806
us 70
if 8
twenty 2
such 2
should 7
come 36
since 7
you 29
will 39
not 85
visit 14
them 9
Depend 17
upon 1
it 67
my 90
dear 15
that 11
when 6
there 21
are 12
twenty 2
I 4330
will 39
visit 14
them 9
all 162
Mr 5
Bennet 1
was 93
so 797
odd 17
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
quick 25
parts 1
sarcastic 2
reserve 7
and 51
caprice 3
that 11
the 193
experience 4
of 109
years 1
had 11
been 1
insufficient 2
to 806
make 17
his 43
wife 6
understand 8
his 43
character 16
mind 25
was 93
less 19
difficult 5
to 806
develop 12
She 199
was 93
a 6799
woman 21
of 109
mean 36
understanding 4
little 6
information 3
and 51
uncertain 5
temper 22
When 6
she 199
was 93
discontented 2
she 199
fancied 1
herself 1
nervous 4
The 193
business 13
of 109
her 181
life 44
was 93
to 806
get 13
her 181
daughters 1
married 3
its 2
solace 4
was 93
visiting 1
and 51
news 71
Chapter 3
Mr 5
Bennet 1
was 93
among 1
the 193
earliest 1
of 109
those 1
who 79
waited 1
on 86
Mr 5
He 962
had 11
always 1
intended 3
to 806
visit 14
him 9
though 12
to 806
the 193
last 7
always 1
assuring 1
his 43
wife 6
that 11
he 962
should 7
not 85
go 501
and 51
till 14
the 193
evening 3
after 48
the 193
visit 14
was 93
paid 1
she 199
had 11
no 896
knowledge 4
of 109
it 67
It 67
was 93
then 5
disclosed 1
in 2719
the 193
following 3
manner 8
Observing 1
his 43
second 16
daughter 4
employed 1
in 2719
trimming 4
a 6799
hat 64
he 962
suddenly 1
addressed 1
her 181
with 34
I 4330
hope 16
Mr 5
will 39
like 22
it 67
Lizzy 2
We 444
are 12
not 85
in 2719
a 6799
way 27
to 806
know 12
_what_ 1
Mr 5
likes 2
said 1
her 181
mother 21
resentfully 1
since 7
we 444
are 12
not 85
to 806
visit 14
But 82
you 29
forget 8
mamma 9
said 1
Elizabeth 5
that 11
we 444
shall 12
meet 9
him 9
at 272
the 193
assemblies 1
and 51
that 11
Mrs 1
Long 49
promised 1
to 806
introduce 3
him 9
I 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
Mrs 1
Long 49
will 39
do 814
any 17
such 2
thing 15
She 199
has 41
two 14
nieces 1
of 109
her 181
own 9
She 199
is 124
a 6799
selfish 4
hypocritical 2
woman 21
and 51
I 4330
have 11
no 896
opinion 4
of 109
her 181
No 896
more 11
have 11
I 4330
said 1
Mr 5
Bennet 1
and 51
I 4330
am 392
glad 30
to 806
find 10
that 11
you 29
do 814
not 85
depend 17
on 86
her 181
serving 3
you 29
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
deigned 1
not 85
to 806
make 17
any 17
reply 3
but 82
unable 1
to 806
contain 16
herself 1
began 1
scolding 3
one 19
of 109
her 181
daughters 1
Don't 1
keep 11
coughing 1
so 797
Kitty 2
for 484
Heaven's 1
sake 2
Have 11
a 6799
little 6
compassion 4
on 86
my 90
nerves 1
You 29
tear 26
them 9
to 806
pieces 1
Kitty 2
has 41
no 896
discretion 3
in 2719
her 181
coughs 1
said 1
her 181
father 12
she 199
times 10
them 9
ill 84
I 4330
do 814
not 85
cough 5
for 484
my 90
own 9
amusement 3
replied 1
Kitty 2
fretfully 1
When 6
is 124
your 4
next 2
ball 77
to 806
be 1200
Lizzy 2
To-morrow 1
fortnight 4
Aye 4
so 797
it 67
is 124
cried 1
her 181
mother 21
and 51
Mrs 1
Long 49
does 5
not 85
come 36
back 182
till 14
the 193
day 27
before 2
so 797
it 67
will 39
be 1200
impossible 2
for 484
her 181
to 806
introduce 3
him 9
for 484
she 199
will 39
not 85
know 12
him 9
herself 1
Then 5
my 90
dear 15
you 29
may 49
have 11
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
your 4
friend 14
and 51
introduce 3
Mr 5
to 806
Impossible 2
Mr 5
Bennet 1
impossible 2
when 6
I 4330
am 392
not 85
acquainted 1
with 34
him 9
myself 1
how 27
can 287
you 29
be 1200
so 797
teasing 2
I 4330
your 4
circumspection 2
A 6799
fortnight's 1
acquaintance 5
is 124
certainly 1
very 1
little 6
One 19
cannot 1
know 12
what 14
a 6799
man 343
really 1
is 124
by 57
the 193
end 92
of 109
a 6799
fortnight 4
But 82
if 8
do 814
not 85
venture 8
somebody 2
else 2
will 39
and 51
after 48
all 162
Mrs 1
Long 49
and 51
her 181
nieces 1
must 28
stand 42
their 2
chance 20
and 51
therefore 1
as 509
she 199
will 39
think 8
it 67
an 970
act 69
of 109
kindness 3
if 8
you 29
decline 7
the 193
office 11
I 4330
will 39
take 18
it 67
on 86
myself 1
The 193
girls 1
stared 1
at 272
their 2
father 12
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
said 1
only 1
Nonsense 2
nonsense 2
What 14
can 287
be 1200
the 193
meaning 11
of 109
that 11
emphatic 2
exclamation 3
cried 1
he 962
Do 814
you 29
consider 13
the 193
forms 1
of 109
introduction 3
and 51
the 193
stress 6
that 11
is 124
laid 1
on 86
them 9
as 509
nonsense 2
I 4330
cannot 1
quite 1
agree 11
with 34
you 29
What 14
say 7
you 29
Mary 13
For 484
you 29
are 12
a 6799
young 9
lady 18
of 109
deep 12
reflection 3
I 4330
know 12
and 51
read 49
great 12
books 15
and 51
make 17
extracts 1
Mary 13
wished 1
to 806
say 7
something 3
sensible 3
but 82
knew 1
not 85
how 27
While 4
Mary 13
is 124
adjusting 1
her 181
ideas 1
he 962
continued 1
let 50
us 70
return 14
to 806
Mr 5
I 4330
am 392
sick 38
of 109
Mr 5
cried 1
his 43
wife 6
I 4330
am 392
sorry 1
to 806
hear 76
but 82
why 4
did 23
not 85
you 29
tell 16
me 1041
that 11
before 2
If 8
I 4330
had 11
known 1
as 509
much 2
this 6
morning 3
I 4330
certainly 1
would 5
not 85
have 11
called 1
on 86
him 9
It 67
is 124
very 1
unlucky 1
but 82
as 509
I 4330
have 11
actually 1
paid 1
the 193
visit 14
we 444
cannot 1
escape 10
the 193
acquaintance 5
now 10
The 193
astonishment 2
of 109
the 193
ladies 1
was 93
just 24
what 14
he 962
wished 1
that 11
of 109
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
perhaps 1
surpassing 1
the 193
rest 110
though 12
when 6
the 193
first 8
tumult 5
of 109
joy 36
was 93
over 596
she 199
began 1
to 806
declare 6
that 11
it 67
was 93
what 14
she 199
had 11
expected 1
all 162
the 193
while 4
How 27
good 29
it 67
was 93
in 2719
you 29
my 90
dear 15
Mr 5
Bennet 1
But 82
I 4330
knew 1
I 4330
should 7
persuade 6
you 29
at 272
last 7
I 4330
was 93
sure 11
you 29
loved 1
your 4
girls 1
too 50
well 24
to 806
neglect 9
such 2
an 970
acquaintance 5
Well 24
how 27
pleased 1
I 4330
am 392
and 51
it 67
is 124
such 2
a 6799
good 29
joke 8
too 50
that 11
you 29
should 7
have 11
gone 4
this 6
morning 3
and 51
never 3
said 1
a 6799
word 26
about 1
it 67
till 14
now 10
Now 10
Kitty 2
you 29
may 49
cough 5
as 509
much 2
as 509
you 29
choose 5
said 1
Mr 5
Bennet 1
and 51
as 509
he 962
spoke 14
he 962
left 19
the 193
room 22
fatigued 1
with 34
the 193
raptures 1
of 109
his 43
wife 6
What 14
an 970
excellent 2
father 12
you 29
have 11
girls 1
said 1
she 199
when 6
the 193
door 41
was 93
shut 32
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
how 27
you 29
will 39
ever 33
make 17
him 9
amends 1
for 484
his 43
kindness 3
or 333
me 1041
either 1
for 484
that 11
matter 7
At 272
our 3
time 45
of 109
life 44
it 67
is 124
not 85
so 797
pleasant 9
I 4330
can 287
tell 16
you 29
to 806
be 1200
making 4
new 115
acquaintances 3
every 10
day 27
but 82
for 484
your 4
we 444
would 5
do 814
anything 3
Lydia 4
my 90
love 29
though 12
you 29
the 193
youngest 1
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
Mr 5
will 39
dance 7
with 34
you 29
at 272
the 193
next 2
ball 77
Oh 17
said 1
Lydia 4
stoutly 1
I 4330
am 392
not 85
afraid 1
for 484
though 12
I 4330
the 193
youngest 1
I'm 1
the 193
tallest 1
The 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
evening 3
was 93
spent 1
in 2719
conjecturing 1
how 27
soon 3
he 962
would 5
return 14
Mr 5
visit 14
and 51
determining 1
when 6
they 5
should 7
ask 6
him 9
to 806
dinner 9
Chapter 3
Not 85
all 162
that 11
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
however 1
with 34
the 193
assistance 2
of 109
her 181
five 5
daughters 1
could 2
ask 6
on 86
the 193
subject 11
was 93
sufficient 2
to 806
draw 24
from 2
her 181
husband 10
any 17
satisfactory 1
description 3
of 109
Mr 5
They 5
attacked 1
him 9
in 2719
various 2
barefaced 2
questions 1
ingenious 4
suppositions 1
and 51
distant 2
surmises 1
but 82
he 962
eluded 1
the 193
skill 11
of 109
them 9
all 162
and 51
they 5
were 5
at 272
last 7
obliged 1
to 806
accept 16
the 193
intelligence 2
of 109
their 2
Lady 18
Lucas 1
Her 181
report 12
was 93
highly 1
Sir 22
William 3
had 11
been 1
delighted 2
with 34
him 9
He 962
was 93
quite 1
young 9
wonderfully 1
handsome 6
extremely 1
agreeable 3
and 51
to 806
crown 5
the 193
whole 26
he 962
meant 3
to 806
be 1200
at 272
the 193
next 2
assembly 8
with 34
a 6799
large 11
party 3
Nothing 5
could 2
be 1200
more 11
delightful 2
To 806
be 1200
fond 17
of 109
dancing 2
was 93
a 6799
certain 5
step 48
towards 1
falling 1
in 2719
love 29
and 51
very 1
lively 1
hopes 1
of 109
Mr 5
heart 57
were 5
entertained 1
If 8
I 4330
can 287
but 82
see 70
one 19
of 109
my 90
daughters 1
happily 1
settled 1
at 272
said 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
to 806
her 181
husband 10
and 51
all 162
the 193
others 1
equally 1
well 24
married 3
I 4330
shall 12
have 11
nothing 5
to 806
wish 13
for 484
In 2719
a 6799
few 6
days 1
Mr 5
returned 1
Mr 5
visit 14
and 51
sat 92
about 1
ten 151
minutes 2
with 34
him 9
in 2719
his 43
library 2
He 962
had 11
entertained 1
hopes 1
of 109
being 3
admitted 2
to 806
a 6799
sight 17
of 109
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
of 109
whose 1
beauty 2
he 962
had 11
heard 1
much 2
but 82
he 962
saw 24
only 1
the 193
father 12
The 193
ladies 1
were 5
somewhat 2
more 11
fortunate 2
for 484
they 5
had 11
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
ascertaining 1
from 2
an 970
upper 15
window 12
that 11
he 962
wore 1
a 6799
blue 61
coat 12
and 51
rode 9
a 6799
black 92
horse 52
An 970
invitation 6
to 806
dinner 9
was 93
soon 3
afterwards 1
dispatched 1
and 51
already 1
had 11
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
planned 1
the 193
courses 1
that 11
were 5
to 806
do 814
credit 12
to 806
her 181
housekeeping 2
when 6
an 970
answer 8
arrived 1
which 2
deferred 1
it 67
all 162
Mr 5
was 93
obliged 1
to 806
be 1200
in 2719
town 27
the 193
following 3
day 27
and 51
consequently 1
unable 1
to 806
accept 16
the 193
of 109
their 2
invitation 6
etc 10
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
was 93
quite 1
disconcerted 1
She 199
could 2
not 85
imagine 3
what 14
business 13
he 962
could 2
have 11
in 2719
town 27
so 797
soon 3
after 48
his 43
arrival 3
in 2719
and 51
she 199
began 1
to 806
fear 14
that 11
he 962
might 9
be 1200
always 1
flying 2
about 1
from 2
one 19
place 29
to 806
another 1
and 51
never 3
settled 1
at 272
as 509
he 962
ought 2
to 806
be 1200
Lady 18
Lucas 1
quieted 1
her 181
fears 2
a 6799
little 6
by 57
starting 1
the 193
idea 21
of 109
his 43
being 3
gone 4
to 806
London 5
only 1
to 806
get 13
a 6799
large 11
party 3
for 484
the 193
ball 77
and 51
a 6799
report 12
soon 3
followed 1
that 11
Mr 5
was 93
to 806
bring 6
twelve 6
ladies 1
and 51
seven 18
gentlemen 1
with 34
him 9
to 806
the 193
assembly 8
The 193
girls 1
grieved 1
over 596
such 2
a 6799
number 8
of 109
ladies 1
but 82
were 5
comforted 1
the 193
day 27
before 2
the 193
ball 77
by 57
hearing 3
that 11
instead 1
of 109
twelve 6
he 962
brought 1
only 1
six 24
with 34
him 9
from 2
five 5
sisters 1
and 51
a 6799
cousin 3
And 51
when 6
the 193
party 3
entered 1
the 193
assembly 8
room 22
it 67
consisted 1
of 109
only 1
five 5
his 43
two 14
sisters 1
the 193
husband 10
of 109
the 193
eldest 1
and 51
another 1
young 9
man 343
Mr 5
was 93
and 51
he 962
had 11
a 6799
pleasant 9
countenance 4
and 51
easy 2
unaffected 2
manners 1
His 43
sisters 1
were 5
fine 17
women 5
with 34
an 970
air 129
of 109
decided 2
fashion 10
His 43
Mr 5
Hurst 2
merely 1
looked 1
the 193
gentleman 3
but 82
his 43
friend 14
Mr 5
Darcy 2
soon 3
drew 2
the 193
attention 3
of 109
the 193
room 22
by 57
his 43
fine 17
tall 35
person 33
handsome 6
features 1
noble 13
mien 3
and 51
the 193
report 12
which 2
was 93
in 2719
general 22
circulation 3
within 3
five 5
minutes 2
after 48
his 43
entrance 6
of 109
his 43
having 1
ten 151
thousand 7
a 6799
year 19
The 193
gentlemen 1
pronounced 1
him 9
to 806
be 1200
a 6799
fine 17
figure 7
of 109
a 6799
man 343
the 193
ladies 1
declared 1
he 962
was 93
much 2
handsomer 1
than 22
Mr 5
and 51
he 962
was 93
looked 1
at 272
with 34
great 12
admiration 2
for 484
about 1
half 23
the 193
evening 3
till 14
his 43
manners 1
gave 4
a 6799
disgust 7
which 2
turned 1
the 193
tide 15
of 109
his 43
popularity 2
for 484
he 962
was 93
discovered 1
to 806
be 1200
proud 5
to 806
be 1200
above 3
his 43
company 2
and 51
above 3
being 3
pleased 1
and 51
not 85
all 162
his 43
large 11
estate 3
in 2719
could 2
then 5
save 7
him 9
from 2
having 1
a 6799
most 3
forbidding 3
disagreeable 3
countenance 4
and 51
being 3
unworthy 1
to 806
be 1200
compared 1
with 34
his 43
friend 14
Mr 5
had 11
soon 3
made 13
himself 1
acquainted 1
with 34
all 162
the 193
principal 7
people 4
in 2719
the 193
room 22
he 962
was 93
lively 1
and 51
unreserved 2
danced 1
every 10
dance 7
was 93
angry 1
that 11
the 193
ball 77
closed 1
so 797
early 1
and 51
talked 1
of 109
giving 2
one 19
himself 1
at 272
Such 2
amiable 1
qualities 1
must 28
speak 12
for 484
themselves 1
What 14
a 6799
contrast 5
between 1
him 9
and 51
his 43
friend 14
Mr 5
Darcy 2
danced 1
only 1
once 2
with 34
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
and 51
once 2
with 34
Miss 71
declined 1
being 3
introduced 1
to 806
any 17
other 5
lady 18
and 51
spent 1
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
evening 3
in 2719
walking 2
about 1
the 193
room 22
speaking 2
occasionally 1
to 806
one 19
of 109
his 43
own 9
party 3
His 43
character 16
was 93
decided 2
He 962
was 93
the 193
proudest 1
most 3
disagreeable 3
man 343
in 2719
the 193
world 12
and 51
everybody 2
hoped 1
that 11
he 962
would 5
never 3
come 36
there 21
again 2
the 193
most 3
violent 2
against 1
him 9
was 93
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
whose 1
dislike 4
of 109
his 43
general 22
was 93
sharpened 1
into 26
particular 13
resentment 3
by 57
his 43
having 1
slighted 1
one 19
of 109
her 181
daughters 1
Elizabeth 5
Bennet 1
had 11
been 1
obliged 1
by 57
the 193
scarcity 2
of 109
gentlemen 1
to 806
sit 29
down 90
for 484
two 14
dances 1
and 51
during 1
part 102
of 109
that 11
time 45
Mr 5
Darcy 2
had 11
been 1
standing 3
near 15
enough 2
for 484
her 181
to 806
hear 76
a 6799
conversation 8
between 1
him 9
and 51
Mr 5
who 79
came 36
from 2
the 193
dance 7
for 484
a 6799
few 6
minutes 2
to 806
press 30
his 43
friend 14
to 806
join 16
it 67
Come 36
Darcy 2
said 1
he 962
I 4330
must 28
have 11
you 29
dance 7
I 4330
hate 14
to 806
see 70
you 29
standing 3
about 1
by 57
yourself 1
in 2719
this 6
stupid 9
manner 8
You 29
had 11
much 2
better 7
dance 7
I 4330
certainly 1
shall 12
not 85
You 29
know 12
how 27
I 4330
detest 8
it 67
unless 1
I 4330
am 392
particularly 1
acquainted 1
with 34
my 90
partner 8
At 272
such 2
an 970
assembly 8
as 509
this 6
it 67
would 5
be 1200
insupportable 1
Your 4
sisters 1
are 12
engaged 1
and 51
there 21
is 124
not 85
another 1
woman 21
in 2719
the 193
room 22
whom 3
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
a 6799
punishment 3
to 806
me 1041
to 806
stand 42
up 194
with 34
I 4330
would 5
not 85
be 1200
so 797
fastidious 4
as 509
you 29
are 12
cried 1
Mr 5
for 484
a 6799
kingdom 3
Upon 1
my 90
I 4330
never 3
met 180
with 34
so 797
many 2
pleasant 9
girls 1
in 2719
my 90
life 44
as 509
I 4330
have 11
this 6
evening 3
and 51
there 21
are 12
several 3
of 109
them 9
you 29
see 70
uncommonly 1
pretty 3
_You_ 1
are 12
dancing 2
with 34
the 193
only 1
handsome 6
girl 14
in 2719
the 193
room 22
said 1
Mr 5
Darcy 2
looking 1
at 272
the 193
eldest 1
Miss 71
Bennet 1
Oh 17
She 199
is 124
the 193
most 3
beautiful 2
creature 3
I 4330
ever 33
beheld 1
But 82
there 21
is 124
one 19
of 109
her 181
sisters 1
sitting 3
down 90
just 24
behind 4
you 29
who 79
is 124
very 1
pretty 3
and 51
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
very 1
agreeable 3
Do 814
let 50
me 1041
ask 6
my 90
partner 8
to 806
introduce 3
you 29
Which 2
do 814
you 29
mean 36
and 51
turning 3
round 29
he 962
looked 1
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
at 272
Elizabeth 5
till 14
catching 2
her 181
eye 57
he 962
withdrew 1
his 43
own 9
and 51
coldly 1
said 1
She 199
is 124
tolerable 1
but 82
not 85
handsome 6
enough 2
to 806
tempt 14
I 4330
am 392
in 2719
no 896
at 272
present 20
to 806
give 15
consequence 3
to 806
young 9
ladies 1
who 79
are 12
slighted 1
by 57
other 5
men 140
You 29
had 11
better 7
return 14
to 806
your 4
partner 8
and 51
enjoy 9
her 181
smiles 1
for 484
you 29
are 12
wasting 1
your 4
time 45
with 34
me 1041
Mr 5
followed 1
his 43
advice 2
Mr 5
Darcy 2
walked 1
off 100
and 51
Elizabeth 5
remained 1
with 34
no 896
very 1
cordial 6
feelings 1
toward 2
him 9
She 199
told 1
the 193
story 13
however 1
with 34
great 12
spirit 20
among 1
her 181
friends 4
for 484
she 199
had 11
a 6799
lively 1
playful 4
disposition 3
which 2
delighted 2
in 2719
anything 3
ridiculous 4
The 193
evening 3
altogether 1
passed 1
off 100
pleasantly 1
to 806
the 193
whole 26
family 2
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
had 11
seen 1
her 181
eldest 1
daughter 4
much 2
admired 1
by 57
the 193
party 3
Mr 5
had 11
danced 1
with 34
her 181
twice 1
and 51
she 199
had 11
been 1
distinguished 1
by 57
his 43
sisters 1
Jane 8
was 93
as 509
much 2
gratified 1
by 57
this 6
as 509
her 181
mother 21
could 2
be 1200
though 12
in 2719
a 6799
quieter 1
way 27
Elizabeth 5
felt 5
pleasure 5
Mary 13
had 11
heard 1
herself 1
mentioned 1
to 806
Miss 71
as 509
the 193
most 3
accomplished 1
girl 14
in 2719
the 193
and 51
Catherine 2
and 51
Lydia 4
had 11
been 1
fortunate 2
enough 2
never 3
to 806
be 1200
without 1
partners 4
which 2
was 93
all 162
that 11
they 5
had 11
yet 4
to 806
care 47
for 484
at 272
a 6799
ball 77
They 5
returned 1
therefore 1
in 2719
good 29
spirits 1
to 806
the 193
village 6
where 21
they 5
lived 1
and 51
of 109
which 2
they 5
were 5
the 193
principal 7
inhabitants 1
They 5
found 18
Mr 5
Bennet 1
still 13
up 194
With 34
a 6799
book 69
he 962
was 93
regardless 1
of 109
time 45
and 51
on 86
the 193
present 20
occasion 7
he 962
had 11
a 6799
good 29
deal 13
of 109
curiosity 2
as 509
to 806
the 193
event 18
of 109
an 970
evening 3
which 2
had 11
raised 1
such 2
splendid 4
expectations 1
He 962
had 11
rather 2
hoped 1
that 11
his 43
wife's 1
views 1
on 86
the 193
stranger 3
would 5
be 1200
disappointed 1
but 82
he 962
soon 3
found 18
out 365
that 11
he 962
had 11
a 6799
different 11
story 13
to 806
hear 76
Oh 17
my 90
dear 15
Mr 5
Bennet 1
as 509
she 199
entered 1
the 193
room 22
we 444
have 11
had 11
a 6799
most 3
delightful 2
evening 3
a 6799
most 3
excellent 2
ball 77
I 4330
wish 13
you 29
had 11
been 1
there 21
Jane 8
was 93
so 797
admired 1
nothing 5
could 2
be 1200
like 22
it 67
Everybody 2
said 1
how 27
well 24
she 199
looked 1
and 51
Mr 5
thought 11
her 181
quite 1
beautiful 2
and 51
danced 1
with 34
her 181
twice 1
Only 1
think 8
of 109
my 90
dear 15
he 962
actually 1
danced 1
with 34
her 181
twice 1
and 51
she 199
was 93
the 193
only 1
creature 3
in 2719
the 193
room 22
that 11
he 962
asked 1
a 6799
second 16
time 45
First 8
of 109
all 162
he 962
asked 1
Miss 71
Lucas 1
I 4330
was 93
so 797
vexed 1
to 806
see 70
him 9
stand 42
up 194
with 34
her 181
But 82
however 1
he 962
did 23
not 85
admire 6
her 181
at 272
all 162
indeed 1
nobody 2
can 287
you 29
know 12
and 51
he 962
seemed 1
quite 1
struck 1
with 34
Jane 8
as 509
she 199
was 93
going 3
down 90
the 193
dance 7
So 797
he 962
inquired 1
who 79
she 199
was 93
and 51
got 14
introduced 1
and 51
asked 1
her 181
for 484
the 193
two 14
next 2
Then 5
the 193
two 14
third 4
he 962
danced 1
with 34
Miss 71
King 23
and 51
the 193
two 14
fourth 4
with 34
Maria 12
Lucas 1
and 51
the 193
two 14
fifth 4
with 34
Jane 8
again 2
and 51
the 193
two 14
sixth 3
with 34
Lizzy 2
and 51
the 193
If 8
he 962
had 11
had 11
any 17
compassion 4
for 484
cried 1
her 181
husband 10
impatiently 1
he 962
would 5
not 85
have 11
danced 1
half 23
so 797
much 2
For 484
God's 1
sake 2
say 7
no 896
more 11
of 109
his 43
partners 4
Oh 17
that 11
he 962
had 11
sprained 1
his 43
ankle 9
in 2719
the 193
first 8
dance 7
Oh 17
my 90
dear 15
I 4330
am 392
quite 1
delighted 2
with 34
him 9
He 962
is 124
so 797
excessively 1
handsome 6
And 51
his 43
sisters 1
are 12
charming 2
women 5
I 4330
never 3
in 2719
my 90
life 44
saw 24
anything 3
more 11
elegant 2
than 22
their 2
dresses 1
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
the 193
lace 18
upon 1
Mrs 1
Hurst's 1
Here 31
she 199
was 93
interrupted 1
again 2
Mr 5
Bennet 1
protested 1
against 1
any 17
description 3
of 109
finery 2
She 199
was 93
therefore 1
obliged 1
to 806
seek 6
another 1
branch 6
of 109
the 193
subject 11
and 51
related 3
with 34
much 2
bitterness 2
of 109
spirit 20
and 51
some 30
exaggeration 3
the 193
shocking 2
rudeness 2
of 109
Mr 5
Darcy 2
But 82
I 4330
can 287
assure 6
you 29
she 199
added 1
that 11
Lizzy 2
does 5
not 85
lose 5
much 2
by 57
not 85
suiting 2
fancy 5
for 484
he 962
is 124
a 6799
most 3
disagreeable 3
horrid 2
man 343
not 85
at 272
all 162
worth 15
pleasing 3
So 797
high 54
and 51
so 797
conceited 4
that 11
there 21
was 93
no 896
enduring 1
him 9
He 962
walked 1
here 31
and 51
he 962
walked 1
there 21
fancying 1
himself 1
so 797
very 1
great 12
Not 85
handsome 6
enough 2
to 806
dance 7
with 34
I 4330
wish 13
you 29
had 11
been 1
there 21
my 90
dear 15
to 806
have 11
given 3
him 9
one 19
of 109
your 4
I 4330
quite 1
detest 8
the 193
man 343
Chapter 3
When 6
Jane 8
and 51
Elizabeth 5
were 5
alone 1
the 193
former 3
who 79
had 11
been 1
cautious 4
in 2719
her 181
praise 7
of 109
Mr 5
before 2
expressed 1
to 806
her 181
sister 9
just 24
how 27
very 1
much 2
she 199
admired 1
him 9
He 962
is 124
just 24
what 14
a 6799
young 9
man 343
ought 2
to 806
be 1200
said 1
she 199
sensible 3
good-humoured 1
lively 1
and 51
I 4330
never 3
saw 24
such 2
happy 1
manners 1
much 2
ease 10
with 34
such 2
perfect 24
good 29
breeding 2
He 962
is 124
also 3
handsome 6
replied 1
Elizabeth 5
which 2
a 6799
young 9
man 343
ought 2
likewise 1
to 806
be 1200
if 8
he 962
possibly 1
can 287
His 43
character 16
is 124
thereby 1
complete 8
I 4330
was 93
very 1
much 2
flattered 1
by 57
his 43
asking 1
me 1041
to 806
dance 7
a 6799
second 16
time 45
I 4330
did 23
not 85
expect 20
such 2
a 6799
compliment 6
Did 23
not 85
you 29
did 23
for 484
you 29
But 82
that 11
is 124
one 19
great 12
difference 3
between 1
us 70
Compliments 1
always 1
take 18
_you_ 1
by 57
surprise 4
and 51
never 3
What 14
could 2
be 1200
more 11
natural 18
than 22
his 43
asking 1
you 29
again 2
He 962
could 2
not 85
help 23
seeing 2
that 11
you 29
were 5
about 1
five 5
times 10
as 509
pretty 3
as 509
every 10
other 5
woman 21
in 2719
the 193
room 22
No 896
thanks 4
to 806
his 43
gallantry 2
for 484
that 11
Well 24
he 962
certainly 1
is 124
very 1
agreeable 3
and 51
I 4330
give 15
you 29
leave 14
to 806
like 22
him 9
You 29
have 11
liked 1
many 2
a 6799
stupider 1
person 33
Dear 15
Lizzy 2
Oh 17
you 29
are 12
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
too 50
apt 9
you 29
know 12
to 806
like 22
people 4
in 2719
general 22
You 29
never 3
see 70
a 6799
fault 20
in 2719
anybody 2
All 162
the 193
world 12
are 12
good 29
and 51
agreeable 3
in 2719
your 4
eyes 8
I 4330
never 3
heard 1
you 29
speak 12
ill 84
of 109
a 6799
human 41
being 3
in 2719
your 4
life 44
I 4330
would 5
not 85
wish 13
to 806
be 1200
hasty 1
in 2719
censuring 1
anyone 2
but 82
I 4330
always 1
speak 12
what 14
I 4330
think 8
I 4330
know 12
you 29
do 814
and 51
it 67
is 124
which 2
makes 4
the 193
wonder 17
With 34
good 29
sense 8
to 806
be 1200
so 797
honestly 1
blind 22
to 806
the 193
follies 1
and 51
nonsense 2
of 109
others 1
Affectation 3
of 109
is 124
common 23
meets 1
with 34
it 67
everywhere 1
But 82
to 806
be 1200
candid 16
without 1
ostentation 2
or 333
take 18
the 193
good 29
of 109
everybody's 1
character 16
and 51
make 17
it 67
still 13
better 7
and 51
say 7
nothing 5
of 109
the 193
to 806
you 29
alone 1
And 51
so 797
you 29
like 22
this 6
man's 1
sisters 1
too 50
do 814
you 29
Their 2
manners 1
are 12
not 85
equal 17
to 806
his 43
Certainly 1
first 8
But 82
they 5
are 12
very 1
pleasing 3
women 5
when 6
you 29
converse 5
with 34
them 9
Miss 71
is 124
to 806
live 43
with 34
her 181
brother 9
and 51
keep 11
his 43
house 87
and 51
I 4330
am 392
much 2
mistaken 2
if 8
we 444
shall 12
not 85
find 10
a 6799
very 1
charming 2
in 2719
her 181
Elizabeth 5
listened 1
in 2719
silence 7
but 82
was 93
not 85
convinced 1
their 2
at 272
the 193
assembly 8
had 11
not 85
been 1
calculated 2
to 806
please 3
in 2719
general 22
and 51
with 34
more 11
quickness 2
of 109
observation 4
and 51
less 19
pliancy 2
of 109
temper 22
than 22
her 181
sister 9
and 51
with 34
a 6799
too 50
by 57
any 17
attention 3
to 806
herself 1
she 199
was 93
very 1
little 6
disposed 1
to 806
approve 3
them 9
They 5
were 5
in 2719
fact 35
very 1
fine 17
ladies 1
not 85
deficient 1
in 2719
good 29
when 6
they 5
were 5
pleased 1
nor 102
in 2719
the 193
power 19
of 109
making 4
themselves 1
agreeable 3
when 6
they 5
chose 2
it 67
but 82
proud 5
and 51
conceited 4
They 5
were 5
rather 2
handsome 6
had 11
been 1
educated 1
in 2719
one 19
of 109
the 193
first 8
private 9
seminaries 1
in 2719
town 27
had 11
a 6799
fortune 8
of 109
twenty 2
thousand 7
pounds 1
were 5
in 2719
the 193
habit 25
of 109
spending 2
more 11
than 22
they 5
ought 2
and 51
of 109
associating 1
with 34
people 4
of 109
rank 19
and 51
were 5
therefore 1
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
entitled 1
to 806
think 8
well 24
of 109
themselves 1
and 51
meanly 1
of 109
others 1
They 5
were 5
of 109
a 6799
respectable 1
family 2
in 2719
the 193
north 42
of 109
England 2
a 6799
circumstance 4
more 11
deeply 1
impressed 1
on 86
their 2
memories 1
than 22
that 11
their 2
brother's 1
fortune 8
and 51
their 2
own 9
had 11
been 1
acquired 1
by 57
trade 20
Mr 5
inherited 1
property 2
to 806
the 193
amount 5
of 109
nearly 1
a 6799
hundred 10
thousand 7
pounds 1
from 2
his 43
father 12
who 79
had 11
intended 3
to 806
purchase 7
an 970
estate 3
but 82
did 23
not 85
live 43
to 806
do 814
it 67
Mr 5
intended 3
it 67
likewise 1
and 51
sometimes 1
made 13
choice 5
of 109
his 43
county 3
but 82
as 509
he 962
was 93
now 10
provided 1
with 34
a 6799
good 29
house 87
and 51
the 193
liberty 2
of 109
a 6799
manor 4
it 67
was 93
doubtful 4
to 806
many 2
of 109
those 1
who 79
best 37
knew 1
the 193
easiness 2
of 109
his 43
temper 22
whether 1
he 962
might 9
not 85
spend 11
the 193
remainder 5
of 109
his 43
days 1
at 272
and 51
leave 14
the 193
next 2
generation 4
to 806
purchase 7
His 43
sisters 1
were 5
anxious 4
for 484
his 43
having 1
an 970
estate 3
of 109
his 43
own 9
but 82
though 12
he 962
was 93
now 10
only 1
established 1
as 509
a 6799
tenant 7
Miss 71
was 93
by 57
no 896
means 1
unwilling 4
to 806
preside 10
at 272
his 43

Mrs 1
Hurst 2
who 79
had 11
married 3
a 6799
man 343
of 109
more 11
fashion 10
than 22
fortune 8
less 19
disposed 1
to 806
consider 13
his 43
house 87
as 509
her 181
home 90
when 6
it 67
suited 1
her 181
Mr 5
had 11
not 85
been 1
of 109
age 24
two 14
years 1
when 6
he 962
was 93
tempted 1
by 57
an 970
accidental 4
recommendation 3
to 806
look 14
at 272
House 87
He 962
did 23
look 14
at 272
it 67
and 51
into 26
it 67
for 484
pleased 1
with 34
the 193
situation 3
and 51
the 193
principal 7
rooms 1
satisfied 1
with 34
what 14
the 193
owner 5
said 1
in 2719
its 2
praise 7
and 51
took 1
it 67
immediately 1
Between 1
him 9
and 51
Darcy 2
there 21
was 93
a 6799
very 1
steady 3
friendship 3
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
great 12
opposition 3
of 109
character 16
was 93
endeared 1
to 806
Darcy 2
by 57
the 193
easiness 2
openness 2
and 51
ductility 2
of 109
his 43
temper 22
though 12
no 896
disposition 3
could 2
offer 10
a 6799
greater 1
contrast 5
to 806
his 43
own 9
and 51
though 12
with 34
his 43
own 9
he 962
never 3
appeared 1
dissatisfied 1
On 86
the 193
strength 10
of 109
Darcy's 1
regard 7
had 11
the 193
firmest 1
reliance 2
and 51
of 109
his 43
the 193
highest 1
opinion 4
In 2719
understanding 4
Darcy 2
was 93
the 193
superior 5
was 93
by 57
no 896
means 1
deficient 1
but 82
Darcy 2
was 93
clever 6
He 962
was 93
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
haughty 1
reserved 4
and 51
fastidious 4
and 51
his 43
manners 1
though 12
were 5
not 85
inviting 2
In 2719
that 11
respect 18
his 43
friend 14
had 11
greatly 1
the 193
advantage 6
was 93
sure 11
of 109
being 3
liked 1
wherever 1
he 962
appeared 1
Darcy 2
was 93
continually 1
giving 2
offense 3
The 193
manner 8
in 2719
which 2
they 5
spoke 14
of 109
the 193
assembly 8
was 93
sufficiently 1
characteristic 4
had 11
never 3
met 180
with 34
more 11
pleasant 9
people 4
or 333
prettier 1
girls 1
in 2719
his 43
life 44
everybody 2
had 11
been 1
most 3
kind 31
and 51
attentive 4
to 806
him 9
there 21
had 11
been 1
no 896
formality 2
no 896
stiffness 2
he 962
had 11
soon 3
felt 5
acquainted 1
with 34
all 162
the 193
room 22
and 51
as 509
to 806
Miss 71
Bennet 1
he 962
could 2
not 85
conceive 3
an 970
angel 27
more 11
beautiful 2
Darcy 2
on 86
the 193
contrary 2
had 11
seen 1
a 6799
collection 3
of 109
people 4
in 2719
whom 3
there 21
was 93
little 6
beauty 2
and 51
no 896
fashion 10
for 484
none 32
of 109
whom 3
he 962
had 11
felt 5
the 193
smallest 1
interest 6
and 51
from 2
none 32
received 1
either 1
attention 3
or 333
pleasure 5
Miss 71
Bennet 1
he 962
acknowledged 1
to 806
be 1200
pretty 3
but 82
she 199
smiled 1
too 50
much 2
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
and 51
her 181
sister 9
allowed 1
it 67
to 806
be 1200
still 13
they 5
admired 1
her 181
and 51
liked 1
her 181
and 51
pronounced 1
her 181
to 806
be 1200
a 6799
sweet 33
girl 14
and 51
one 19
whom 3
they 5
would 5
not 85
object 26
to 806
know 12
more 11
of 109
Miss 71
Bennet 1
was 93
therefore 1
established 1
as 509
a 6799
sweet 33
girl 14
and 51
their 2
brother 9
felt 5
authorized 1
by 57
such 2
commendation 3
to 806
think 8
of 109
her 181
as 509
he 962
chose 2
Chapter 3
Within 3
a 6799
short 62
walk 25
of 109
lived 1
a 6799
family 2
with 34
whom 3
the 193
were 5
particularly 1
intimate 5
Sir 22
William 3
Lucas 1
had 11
been 1
formerly 1
in 2719
trade 20
in 2719
where 21
he 962
had 11
made 13
a 6799
tolerable 1
fortune 8
and 51
risen 1
to 806
the 193
of 109
knighthood 3
by 57
an 970
address 9
to 806
the 193
king 23
during 1
his 43
mayoralty 2
The 193
distinction 3
had 11
perhaps 1
been 1
felt 5
too 50
strongly 1
It 67
had 11
given 3
him 9
a 6799
disgust 7
to 806
his 43
business 13
and 51
to 806
his 43
residence 3
in 2719
a 6799
small 14
market 18
town 27
and 51
in 2719
quitting 1
them 9
both 8
he 962
had 11
removed 1
with 34
his 43
family 2
to 806
a 6799
house 87
about 1
a 6799
mile 15
from 2
denominated 1
from 2
that 11
period 16
Lucas 1
Lodge 7
where 21
he 962
could 2
think 8
with 34
pleasure 5
of 109
his 43
own 9
importance 2
and 51
unshackled 1
by 57
business 13
occupy 2
himself 1
solely 1
in 2719
being 3
civil 15
to 806
all 162
the 193
world 12
For 484
though 12
elated 2
by 57
his 43
rank 19
it 67
did 23
not 85
render 7
him 9
supercilious 4
on 86
the 193
contrary 2
he 962
was 93
all 162
attention 3
to 806
everybody 2
By 57
nature 3
inoffensive 4
friendly 2
and 51
obliging 2
his 43
presentation 3
at 272
St 1910
James's 1
had 11
made 13
him 9
courteous 4
Lady 18
Lucas 1
was 93
a 6799
very 1
good 29
kind 31
of 109
woman 21
not 85
too 50
clever 6
to 806
be 1200
a 6799
valuable 3
to 806
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
They 5
had 11
several 3
children 1
The 193
eldest 1
of 109
them 9
a 6799
sensible 3
intelligent 4
young 9
woman 21
about 1
was 93
Elizabeth's 1
intimate 5
friend 14
That 11
the 193
Miss 71
and 51
the 193
Miss 71
should 7
meet 9
to 806
talk 18
over 596
a 6799
ball 77
was 93
absolutely 1
necessary 2
and 51
the 193
morning 3
after 48
the 193
assembly 8
brought 1
the 193
former 3
to 806
to 806
hear 76
and 51
to 806
communicate 3
_You_ 1
began 1
the 193
evening 3
well 24
Charlotte 4
said 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
with 34
civil 15
to 806
Miss 71
Lucas 1
_You_ 1
were 5
Mr 5
first 8
choice 5
Yes 16
but 82
he 962
seemed 1
to 806
like 22
his 43
second 16
better 7
Oh 17
you 29
mean 36
Jane 8
I 4330
suppose 4
because 1
he 962
danced 1
with 34
her 181
twice 1
To 806
be 1200
sure 11
that 11
seem 10
as 509
if 8
he 962
admired 1
I 4330
rather 2
believe 6
he 962
heard 1
something 3
about 1
I 4330
hardly 1
know 12
about 1
Mr 5
Robinson 1
Perhaps 1
you 29
mean 36
what 14
I 4330
overheard 1
between 1
him 9
and 51
Mr 5
Robinson 1
did 23
not 85
I 4330
mention 5
it 67
to 806
you 29
Mr 5
asking 1
him 9
how 27
he 962
liked 1
our 3
assemblies 1
and 51
whether 1
he 962
did 23
not 85
think 8
there 21
were 5
a 6799
great 12
many 2
pretty 3
women 5
in 2719
the 193
room 22
and 51
he 962
thought 11
the 193
prettiest 1
and 51
his 43
answering 1
immediately 1
to 806
the 193
last 7
question 16
the 193
eldest 1
Miss 71
Bennet 1
beyond 1
a 6799
doubt 15
there 21
cannot 1
be 1200
two 14
opinions 1
on 86
that 11
point 22
Upon 1
my 90
word 26
Well 24
that 11
is 124
very 1
decided 2
does 5
seem 10
as 509
however 1
it 67
may 49
all 162
come 36
to 806
nothing 5
you 29
know 12
were 5
more 11
to 806
the 193
purpose 12
than 22
Eliza 7
said 1
Charlotte 4
Mr 5
Darcy 2
is 124
not 85
so 797
well 24
worth 15
listening 1
to 806
as 509
his 43
friend 14
is 124
he 962
Eliza 7
be 1200
only 1
just 24
I 4330
beg 59
you 29
would 5
not 85
put 47
it 67
into 26
Lizzy's 1
head 140
to 806
be 1200
vexed 1
by 57
his 43
for 484
he 962
is 124
such 2
a 6799
disagreeable 3
man 343
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
quite 1
a 6799
misfortune 3
to 806
be 1200
liked 1
by 57
him 9
Mrs 1
Long 49
told 1
me 1041
last 7
night 61
that 11
he 962
sat 92
close 22
to 806
her 181
for 484
without 1
once 2
opening 3
his 43
lips 8
Are 12
you 29
quite 1
sure 11
ma'am 1
not 85
there 21
a 6799
little 6
mistake 5
said 1
Jane 8
I 4330
certainly 1
saw 24
Mr 5
Darcy 2
speaking 2
to 806
her 181
she 199
asked 1
him 9
at 272
last 7
how 27
he 962
liked 1
and 51
he 962
could 2
not 85
help 23
answering 1
her 181
but 82
she 199
said 1
he 962
seemed 1
quite 1
angry 1
at 272
being 3
spoke 14
to 806
Miss 71
told 1
me 1041
said 1
Jane 8
that 11
he 962
never 3
speaks 1
much 2
unless 1
among 1
his 43
intimate 5
acquaintances 3
With 34
he 962
is 124
remarkably 1
agreeable 3
I 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
a 6799
word 26
of 109
it 67
my 90
dear 15
If 8
he 962
had 11
been 1
so 797
very 1
agreeable 3
he 962
would 5
have 11
talked 1
to 806
Mrs 1
Long 49
But 82
I 4330
can 287
guess 16
how 27
it 67
was 93
everybody 2
says 1
that 11
he 962
is 124
eat 15
up 194
with 34
pride 6
and 51
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
he 962
had 11
heard 1
somehow 1
that 11
Mrs 1
Long 49
does 5
not 85
keep 11
a 6799
carriage 5
and 51
had 11
come 36
to 806
the 193
ball 77
in 2719
a 6799
hack 28
chaise 3
I 4330
do 814
not 85
mind 25
his 43
not 85
talking 1
to 806
Mrs 1
Long 49
said 1
Miss 71
Lucas 1
but 82
I 4330
wish 13
he 962
had 11
danced 1
with 34
Eliza 7
Another 1
time 45
Lizzy 2
said 1
her 181
mother 21
I 4330
would 5
not 85
dance 7
with 34
if 8
I 4330
were 5
you 29
I 4330
believe 6
ma'am 1
I 4330
may 49
safely 1
promise 4
you 29
to 806
dance 7
with 34
him 9
His 43
pride 6
said 1
Miss 71
Lucas 1
does 5
not 85
offend 7
so 797
much 2
as 509
pride 6
often 4
does 5
because 1
there 21
is 124
an 970
excuse 4
for 484
it 67
One 19
cannot 1
wonder 17
that 11
so 797
very 1
fine 17
a 6799
young 9
man 343
with 34
family 2
fortune 8
everything 2
in 2719
his 43
should 7
think 8
highly 1
of 109
himself 1
If 8
I 4330
may 49
so 797
express 25
it 67
he 962
has 41
a 6799
to 806
be 1200
proud 5
That 11
is 124
very 1
true 9
replied 1
Elizabeth 5
and 51
I 4330
could 2
easily 1
forgive 8
pride 6
if 8
he 962
had 11
not 85
mortified 1
Pride 6
observed 1
Mary 13
who 79
piqued 1
herself 1
upon 1
the 193
solidity 2
of 109
her 181
reflections 1
is 124
a 6799
very 1
common 23
failing 3
I 4330
believe 6
By 57
all 162
that 11
I 4330
have 11
ever 33
read 49
I 4330
am 392
convinced 1
that 11
it 67
is 124
very 1
common 23
indeed 1
that 11
human 41
nature 3
is 124
particularly 1
prone 3
to 806
it 67
and 51
that 11
there 21
are 12
very 1
few 6
of 109
us 70
who 79
do 814
not 85
cherish 4
a 6799
feeling 4
of 109
on 86
the 193
score 19
of 109
some 30
quality 2
or 333
other 5
real 47
or 333
imaginary 1
Vanity 2
and 51
pride 6
are 12
different 11
things 1
though 12
the 193
words 5
are 12
often 4
used 1
A 6799
person 33
may 49
be 1200
proud 5
without 1
being 3
vain 8
Pride 6
relates 1
more 11
to 806
our 3
opinion 4
of 109
ourselves 1
vanity 2
to 806
what 14
we 444
would 5
have 11
others 1
think 8
of 109
us 70
If 8
I 4330
were 5
as 509
rich 19
as 509
Mr 5
Darcy 2
cried 1
a 6799
young 9
Lucas 1
who 79
came 36
with 34
his 43
sisters 1
I 4330
should 7
not 85
care 47
how 27
proud 5
I 4330
was 93
I 4330
would 5
keep 11
a 6799
pack 29
of 109
foxhounds 1
and 51
drink 9
a 6799
bottle 10
of 109
wine 18
a 6799
day 27
Then 5
you 29
would 5
drink 9
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
more 11
than 22
you 29
ought 2
said 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
and 51
if 8
I 4330
were 5
to 806
see 70
you 29
at 272
it 67
I 4330
should 7
take 18
away 1
your 4
bottle 10
directly 1
The 193
boy 25
protested 1
that 11
she 199
should 7
not 85
she 199
continued 1
to 806
declare 6
that 11
she 199
would 5
and 51
the 193
argument 9
ended 1
only 1
with 34
the 193
visit 14
Chapter 3
The 193
ladies 1
of 109
soon 3
waited 1
on 86
those 1
of 109
The 193
visit 14
was 93
soon 3
returned 1
in 2719
due 21
form 68
Miss 71
pleasing 3
manners 1
grew 1
on 86
the 193
goodwill 2
of 109
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
and 51
Miss 71
and 51
though 12
the 193
mother 21
was 93
found 18
to 806
be 1200
intolerable 1
and 51
the 193
younger 1
sisters 1
not 85
worth 15
speaking 2
to 806
a 6799
wish 13
of 109
being 3
better 7
acquainted 1
with 34
was 93
expressed 1
towards 1
the 193
two 14
eldest 1
By 57
Jane 8
this 6
attention 3
was 93
received 1
with 34
the 193
greatest 1
pleasure 5
but 82
Elizabeth 5
still 13
saw 24
superciliousness 2
in 2719
their 2
treatment 3
of 109
everybody 2
hardly 1
excepting 1
even 36
her 181
sister 9
and 51
could 2
not 85
like 22
them 9
though 12
their 2
kindness 3
to 806
Jane 8
such 2
as 509
it 67
was 93
had 11
a 6799
value 8
as 509
arising 1
in 2719
all 162
probability 2
from 2
the 193
influence 4
of 109
their 2
brother's 1
admiration 2
It 67
was 93
generally 1
evident 2
whenever 1
they 5
met 180
that 11
he 962
admire 6
her 181
and 51
to 806
it 67
was 93
equally 1
evident 2
that 11
Jane 8
was 93
yielding 2
to 806
the 193
preference 3
which 2
she 199
had 11
begun 1
to 806
entertain 12
for 484
him 9
from 2
the 193
first 8
and 51
was 93
in 2719
a 6799
way 27
to 806
be 1200
very 1
much 2
in 2719
love 29
but 82
she 199
considered 1
with 34
pleasure 5
that 11
it 67
was 93
not 85
likely 1
to 806
be 1200
discovered 1
by 57
the 193
world 12
in 2719
general 22
since 7
Jane 8
united 2
with 34
great 12
strength 10
of 109
feeling 4
a 6799
composure 2
of 109
temper 22
and 51
a 6799
uniform 8
cheerfulness 2
of 109
manner 8
which 2
would 5
guard 26
her 181
from 2
the 193
suspicions 1
of 109
the 193
impertinent 2
She 199
mentioned 1
this 6
to 806
her 181
friend 14
Miss 71
Lucas 1
It 67
may 49
perhaps 1
be 1200
pleasant 9
replied 1
Charlotte 4
to 806
be 1200
able 3
to 806
impose 6
on 86
the 193
public 18
in 2719
such 2
a 6799
case 25
but 82
it 67
is 124
sometimes 1
a 6799
disadvantage 6
to 806
be 1200
so 797
very 1
guarded 2
If 8
a 6799
woman 21
conceals 1
her 181
affection 5
with 34
the 193
same 5
skill 11
from 2
the 193
object 26
of 109
it 67
she 199
may 49
lose 5
the 193
opportunity 2
of 109
fixing 3
him 9
and 51
it 67
will 39
then 5
be 1200
but 82
poor 11
consolation 3
to 806
believe 6
the 193
world 12
equally 1
in 2719
the 193
dark 19
There 21
is 124
so 797
much 2
of 109
gratitude 2
or 333
vanity 2
in 2719
almost 1
every 10
attachment 3
that 11
it 67
is 124
not 85
safe 20
to 806
leave 14
any 17
to 806
itself 1
We 444
can 287
all 162
slight 10
preference 3
is 124
natural 18
enough 2
but 82
there 21
are 12
very 1
few 6
of 109
us 70
who 79
have 11
heart 57
enough 2
to 806
be 1200
really 1
in 2719
love 29
without 1
encouragement 3
In 2719
nine 21
cases 1
out 365
of 109
ten 151
a 6799
woman 21
had 11
better 7
show 64
affection 5
than 22
she 199
feels 1
likes 2
your 4
sister 9
undoubtedly 1
but 82
he 962
may 49
never 3
do 814
more 11
than 22
like 22
her 181
if 8
she 199
does 5
not 85
help 23
him 9
on 86
But 82
she 199
does 5
help 23
him 9
on 86
as 509
much 2
as 509
her 181
nature 3
will 39
allow 9
If 8
can 287
perceive 3
her 181
regard 7
for 484
him 9
he 962
must 28
be 1200
a 6799
simpleton 3
indeed 1
not 85
to 806
discover 10
it 67
too 50
Remember 4
Eliza 7
that 11
he 962
does 5
not 85
know 12
disposition 3
as 509
you 29
do 814
But 82
if 8
a 6799
woman 21
is 124
partial 6
to 806
a 6799
man 343
and 51
does 5
not 85
to 806
conceal 10
it 67
he 962
must 28
find 10
it 67
out 365
Perhaps 1
he 962
must 28
if 8
he 962
sees 6
enough 2
of 109
her 181
But 82
though 12
and 51
Jane 8
meet 9
tolerably 1
often 4
it 67
is 124
never 3
for 484
many 2
hours 1
together 3
and 51
as 509
they 5
always 1
see 70
each 1
other 5
in 2719
large 11
mixed 1
parties 1
it 67
is 124
impossible 2
that 11
every 10
moment 14
should 7
be 1200
employed 1
in 2719
conversing 1
together 3
Jane 8
should 7
therefore 1
make 17
the 193
most 3
of 109
every 10
in 2719
which 2
she 199
can 287
command 21
his 43
attention 3
When 6
she 199
is 124
secure 6
of 109
him 9
there 21
will 39
be 1200
more 11
leisure 8
for 484
falling 1
in 2719
love 29
as 509
much 2
as 509
she 199
chooses 1
Your 4
plan 61
is 124
a 6799
good 29
one 19
replied 1
Elizabeth 5
where 21
nothing 5
is 124
in 2719
question 16
but 82
the 193
desire 6
of 109
being 3
well 24
married 3
and 51
if 8
I 4330
were 5
determined 2
to 806
get 13
a 6799
rich 19
husband 10
or 333
any 17
husband 10
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
I 4330
should 7
adopt 12
it 67
But 82
these 4
are 12
not 85
feelings 1
she 199
is 124
not 85
acting 2
by 57
design 16
As 509
yet 4
she 199
cannot 1
even 36
be 1200
certain 5
of 109
the 193
degree 3
of 109
her 181
own 9
regard 7
nor 102
of 109
its 2
reasonableness 2
She 199
has 41
known 1
him 9
only 1
a 6799
fortnight 4
She 199
danced 1
four 26
dances 1
with 34
him 9
at 272
she 199
saw 24
him 9
one 19
morning 3
at 272
his 43
own 9
house 87
and 51
has 41
since 7
dined 1
with 34
him 9
in 2719
company 2
four 26
times 10
This 6
is 124
not 85
quite 1
enough 2
to 806
make 17
her 181
understand 8
his 43
character 16
Not 85
as 509
you 29
represent 11
it 67
Had 11
she 199
merely 1
with 34
him 9
she 199
might 9
only 1
have 11
discovered 1
whether 1
he 962
had 11
a 6799
good 29
appetite 3
but 82
you 29
must 28
remember 4
that 11
four 26
evenings 1
have 11
also 3
been 1
spent 1
four 26
evenings 1
may 49
do 814
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
Yes 16
these 4
four 26
evenings 1
have 11
enabled 1
them 9
to 806
ascertain 7
that 11
they 5
both 8
like 22
better 7
than 22
Commerce 2
but 82
with 34
respect 18
to 806
any 17
other 5
leading 2
characteristic 4
I 4330
do 814
not 85
imagine 3
that 11
much 2
has 41
been 1
unfolded 1
Well 24
said 1
Charlotte 4
I 4330
wish 13
Jane 8
success 13
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
and 51
if 8
she 199
were 5
married 3
to 806
him 9
to-morrow 1
I 4330
should 7
think 8
she 199
had 11
as 509
good 29
a 6799
chance 20
of 109
happiness 2
as 509
if 8
she 199
were 5
to 806
be 1200
studying 1
his 43
character 16
for 484
a 6799
twelvemonth 3
Happiness 2
in 2719
marriage 6
is 124
entirely 1
a 6799
matter 7
of 109
chance 20
If 8
the 193
dispositions 1
of 109
the 193
parties 1
are 12
ever 33
so 797
well 24
known 1
to 806
each 1
other 5
or 333
ever 33
so 797
similar 5
beforehand 1
it 67
does 5
not 85
advance 7
their 2
felicity 2
in 2719
the 193
least 3
They 5
always 1
continue 3
to 806
grow 22
sufficiently 1
unlike 10
afterwards 1
to 806
have 11
their 2
share 22
of 109
vexation 3
and 51
it 67
is 124
better 7
to 806
know 12
as 509
little 6
as 509
possible 3
of 109
the 193
defects 1
of 109
the 193
person 33
with 34
whom 3
you 29
are 12
to 806
pass 66
your 4
life 44
You 29
make 17
me 1041
laugh 14
Charlotte 4
but 82
it 67
is 124
not 85
sound 29
You 29
know 12
it 67
is 124
not 85
sound 29
and 51
that 11
you 29
would 5
never 3
act 69
in 2719
this 6
way 27
yourself 1
Occupied 1
in 2719
observing 1
Mr 5
attentions 1
to 806
her 181
sister 9
Elizabeth 5
was 93
far 91
from 2
suspecting 1
that 11
she 199
was 93
herself 1
becoming 2
an 970
object 26
of 109
some 30
interest 6
in 2719
the 193
eyes 8
of 109
his 43
friend 14
Mr 5
Darcy 2
had 11
at 272
first 8
scarcely 1
allowed 1
her 181
to 806
be 1200
pretty 3
he 962
had 11
looked 1
at 272
her 181
without 1
admiration 2
at 272
the 193
ball 77
and 51
when 6
they 5
next 2
met 180
he 962
looked 1
at 272
her 181
only 1
to 806
But 82
no 896
sooner 1
had 11
he 962
made 13
it 67
clear 23
to 806
himself 1
and 51
his 43
friends 4
that 11
she 199
hardly 1
had 11
a 6799
good 29
feature 5
in 2719
her 181
face 19
than 22
he 962
began 1
to 806
find 10
it 67
was 93
rendered 1
uncommonly 1
intelligent 4
by 57
the 193
beautiful 2
expression 11
of 109
her 181
dark 19
eyes 8
To 806
this 6
discovery 2
succeeded 1
some 30
others 1
equally 1
mortifying 1
Though 12
he 962
had 11
detected 1
with 34
a 6799
critical 2
eye 57
more 11
than 22
one 19
failure 3
of 109
perfect 24
symmetry 2
in 2719
her 181
form 68
he 962
was 93
forced 1
to 806
acknowledge 3
her 181
figure 7
to 806
be 1200
light 42
and 51
pleasing 3
and 51
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
his 43
asserting 1
that 11
her 181
manners 1
were 5
not 85
those 1
of 109
the 193
fashionable 1
world 12
he 962
was 93
caught 1
by 57
their 2
easy 2
playfulness 2
Of 109
this 6
she 199
was 93
perfectly 1
unaware 4
to 806
her 181
he 962
was 93
only 1
the 193
man 343
who 79
made 13
himself 1
agreeable 3
nowhere 2
and 51
who 79
had 11
not 85
thought 11
her 181
handsome 6
enough 2
to 806
dance 7
with 34
He 962
began 1
to 806
wish 13
to 806
know 12
more 11
of 109
her 181
and 51
as 509
a 6799
step 48
towards 1
conversing 1
with 34
her 181
himself 1
attended 1
to 806
her 181
conversation 8
with 34
others 1
His 43
doing 3
so 797
drew 2
her 181
notice 8
It 67
was 93
at 272
Sir 22
William 3
where 21
a 6799
large 11
party 3
were 5
assembled 1
What 14
does 5
Mr 5
Darcy 2
mean 36
said 1
she 199
to 806
Charlotte 4
by 57
listening 1
to 806
my 90
conversation 8
with 34
Colonel 5
Forster 1
That 11
is 124
a 6799
question 16
which 2
Mr 5
Darcy 2
only 1
can 287
answer 8
But 82
if 8
he 962
does 5
it 67
any 17
more 11
I 4330
shall 12
certainly 1
let 50
him 9
know 12
that 11
I 4330
see 70
what 14
he 962
is 124
about 1
He 962
has 41
a 6799
very 1
satirical 2
eye 57
and 51
if 8
I 4330
do 814
not 85
begin 8
by 57
being 3
impertinent 2
myself 1
I 4330
shall 12
soon 3
grow 22
afraid 1
of 109
him 9
On 86
his 43
approaching 1
them 9
soon 3
afterwards 1
though 12
without 1
seeming 2
to 806
have 11
any 17
intention 5
of 109
speaking 2
Miss 71
Lucas 1
defied 1
her 181
friend 14
to 806
mention 5
such 2
a 6799
subject 11
to 806
him 9
which 2
immediately 1
provoking 2
Elizabeth 5
to 806
do 814
it 67
she 199
turned 1
to 806
him 9
and 51
said 1
Did 23
you 29
not 85
think 8
Mr 5
Darcy 2
that 11
I 4330
expressed 1
myself 1
uncommonly 1
well 24
just 24
now 10
when 6
I 4330
was 93
teasing 2
Colonel 5
Forster 1
to 806
give 15
us 70
a 6799
ball 77
at 272
With 34
great 12
energy 2
but 82
it 67
is 124
always 1
a 6799
subject 11
which 2
makes 4
a 6799
lady 18
energetic 2
You 29
are 12
severe 7
on 86
us 70
It 67
will 39
be 1200
turn 46
soon 3
to 806
be 1200
teased 1
said 1
Miss 71
Lucas 1
I 4330
am 392
going 3
to 806
open 21
the 193
instrument 16
Eliza 7
and 51
you 29
know 12
what 14
follows 1
You 29
are 12
a 6799
very 1
strange 8
creature 3
by 57
way 27
of 109
a 6799
friend 14
wanting 1
me 1041
to 806
play 73
and 51
sing 52
before 2
anybody 2
and 51
everybody 2
If 8
my 90
vanity 2
had 11
taken 1
a 6799
musical 9
turn 46
you 29
would 5
have 11
been 1
invaluable 1
but 82
as 509
it 67
is 124
I 4330
would 5
really 1
rather 2
not 85
sit 29
down 90
before 2
those 1
who 79
must 28
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
habit 25
of 109
hearing 3
the 193
very 1
best 37
performers 1
On 86
Miss 71
persevering 1
however 1
she 199
added 1
Very 1
well 24
if 8
it 67
must 28
be 1200
so 797
it 67
must 28
And 51
gravely 1
glancing 1
at 272
Mr 5
Darcy 2
There 21
is 124
a 6799
fine 17
old 21
saying 3
which 2
everybody 2
here 31
is 124
of 109
course 10
familiar 12
with 34
your 4
breath 27
to 806
cool 22
your 4
porridge' 1
and 51
I 4330
shall 12
keep 11
mine 26
to 806
swell 13
my 90
song 26
Her 181
performance 3
was 93
pleasing 3
though 12
by 57
no 896
means 1
capital 17
After 48
a 6799
song 26
or 333
two 14
and 51
before 2
she 199
could 2
reply 3
to 806
the 193
entreaties 1
of 109
several 3
that 11
she 199
would 5
sing 52
again 2
she 199
was 93
eagerly 1
succeeded 1
at 272
the 193
instrument 16
by 57
her 181
sister 9
Mary 13
who 79
having 1
in 2719
consequence 3
of 109
being 3
the 193
only 1
plain 27
one 19
in 2719
the 193
family 2
worked 1
hard 70
for 484
knowledge 4
and 51
accomplishments 1
was 93
always 1
impatient 2
for 484
display 6
Mary 13
had 11
neither 1
genius 3
nor 102
taste 15
and 51
though 12
vanity 2
had 11
given 3
her 181
application 3
it 67
had 11
given 3
her 181
likewise 1
a 6799
pedantic 2
air 129
and 51
conceited 4
manner 8
which 2
would 5
have 11
injured 1
a 6799
higher 2
degree 3
of 109
excellence 2
than 22
she 199
had 11
reached 1
Elizabeth 5
easy 2
and 51
unaffected 2
had 11
been 1
listened 1
to 806
with 34
much 2
more 11
pleasure 5
though 12
not 85
playing 1
half 23
so 797
well 24
and 51
Mary 13
at 272
the 193
end 92
of 109
a 6799
long 49
concerto 3
was 93
glad 30
to 806
purchase 7
praise 7
and 51
gratitude 2
by 57
Scotch 12
and 51
Irish 9
airs 18
at 272
the 193
request 6
of 109
her 181
younger 1
sisters 1
who 79
with 34
some 30
of 109
the 193
and 51
two 14
or 333
three 12
officers 1
joined 1
eagerly 1
in 2719
dancing 2
at 272
one 19
end 92
of 109
the 193
room 22
Mr 5
Darcy 2
stood 1
near 15
them 9
in 2719
silent 6
indignation 2
at 272
such 2
a 6799
mode 57
of 109
passing 3
the 193
evening 3
to 806
the 193
exclusion 4
of 109
all 162
conversation 8
and 51
was 93
too 50
much 2
engrossed 1
by 57
his 43
thoughts 1
to 806
perceive 3
that 11
Sir 22
William 3
Lucas 1
was 93
his 43
till 14
Sir 22
William 3
thus 1
began 1
What 14
a 6799
charming 2
amusement 3
for 484
young 9
people 4
this 6
is 124
Mr 5
Darcy 2
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
like 22
dancing 2
after 48
all 162
I 4330
consider 13
it 67
as 509
one 19
of 109
the 193
first 8
refinements 1
of 109
polished 1
society 2
Certainly 1
sir 22
and 51
it 67
has 41
the 193
advantage 6
also 3
of 109
being 3
in 2719
vogue 3
the 193
less 19
polished 1
societies 1
of 109
the 193
world 12
Every 10
savage 12
can 287
dance 7
Sir 22
William 3
only 1
smiled 1
Your 4
friend 14
performs 1
delightfully 1
he 962
continued 1
after 48
a 6799
pause 4
on 86
seeing 2
join 16
the 193
group 15
and 51
I 4330
doubt 15
not 85
that 11
you 29
are 12
an 970
adept 6
in 2719
the 193
science 3
yourself 1
Mr 5
Darcy 2
You 29
saw 24
me 1041
dance 7
at 272
I 4330
believe 6
sir 22
Yes 16
indeed 1
and 51
received 1
no 896
inconsiderable 1
pleasure 5
from 2
the 193
sight 17
Do 814
you 29
often 4
dance 7
at 272
St 1910
James's 1
Never 3
sir 22
Do 814
you 29
not 85
think 8
it 67
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
proper 9
compliment 6
to 806
the 193
place 29
It 67
is 124
a 6799
compliment 6
which 2
I 4330
never 3
pay 52
to 806
any 17
place 29
if 8
I 4330
can 287
avoid 8
it 67
You 29
have 11
a 6799
house 87
in 2719
town 27
I 4330
conclude 3
Mr 5
Darcy 2
bowed 1
I 4330
had 11
once 2
had 11
some 30
thought 11
of 109
fixing 3
in 2719
town 27
I 4330
am 392
fond 17
of 109
superior 5
society 2
but 82
I 4330
did 23
not 85
feel 11
quite 1
certain 5
that 11
the 193
air 129
of 109
London 5
would 5
agree 11
with 34
Lady 18
Lucas 1
He 962
paused 1
in 2719
hopes 1
of 109
an 970
answer 8
but 82
his 43
companion 10
was 93
not 85
disposed 1
to 806
make 17
any 17
and 51
Elizabeth 5
at 272
that 11
instant 11
moving 2
towards 1
them 9
he 962
was 93
struck 1
with 34
the 193
action 4
of 109
doing 3
a 6799
very 1
gallant 6
thing 15
and 51
called 1
out 365
to 806
her 181
My 90
dear 15
Miss 71
Eliza 7
why 4
are 12
you 29
not 85
dancing 2
Mr 5
Darcy 2
you 29
must 28
allow 9
me 1041
to 806
present 20
this 6
young 9
lady 18
to 806
you 29
as 509
a 6799
very 1
desirable 3
partner 8
You 29
cannot 1
refuse 4
to 806
dance 7
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
when 6
so 797
much 2
beauty 2
is 124
before 2
you 29
And 51
taking 4
her 181
hand 137
he 962
would 5
have 11
given 3
it 67
to 806
Mr 5
Darcy 2
who 79
though 12
extremely 1
surprised 1
was 93
not 85
unwilling 4
to 806
receive 8
it 67
when 6
she 199
instantly 1
drew 2
back 182
and 51
said 1
with 34
some 30
discomposure 2
to 806
Sir 22
William 3
Indeed 1
sir 22
I 4330
have 11
not 85
the 193
least 3
intention 5
of 109
dancing 2
I 4330
entreat 8
you 29
not 85
to 806
suppose 4
that 11
I 4330
moved 1
this 6
way 27
in 2719
order 11
to 806
beg 59
for 484
a 6799
partner 8
Mr 5
Darcy 2
with 34
grave 28
propriety 2
requested 1
to 806
be 1200
allowed 1
the 193
of 109
her 181
hand 137
but 82
in 2719
vain 8
Elizabeth 5
was 93
determined 2
nor 102
did 23
Sir 22
William 3
at 272
all 162
shake 19
her 181
purpose 12
by 57
his 43
attempt 5
at 272
persuasion 3
You 29
excel 13
so 797
much 2
in 2719
the 193
dance 7
Miss 71
Eliza 7
that 11
it 67
is 124
cruel 9
to 806
deny 2
me 1041
the 193
happiness 2
of 109
seeing 2
you 29
and 51
though 12
this 6
gentleman 3
dislikes 1
the 193
amusement 3
in 2719
general 22
he 962
can 287
have 11
no 896
objection 5
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
to 806
oblige 3
us 70
for 484
one 19
Mr 5
Darcy 2
is 124
all 162
politeness 2
said 1
Elizabeth 5
smiling 2
He 962
is 124
indeed 1
but 82
considering 1
the 193
inducement 3
my 90
dear 15
Miss 71
Eliza 7
we 444
cannot 1
wonder 17
at 272
his 43
who 79
would 5
object 26
to 806
such 2
a 6799
partner 8
Elizabeth 5
looked 1
archly 1
and 51
turned 1
away 1
Her 181
resistance 3
had 11
not 85
injured 1
her 181
with 34
the 193
gentleman 3
and 51
he 962
was 93
thinking 2
of 109
her 181
with 34
some 30
complacency 2
when 6
thus 1
accosted 1
by 57
Miss 71
I 4330
can 287
guess 16
the 193
subject 11
of 109
your 4
reverie 3
I 4330
should 7
imagine 3
not 85
You 29
are 12
considering 1
how 27
insupportable 1
it 67
would 5
be 1200
to 806
pass 66
many 2
evenings 1
in 2719
this 6
such 2
society 2
and 51
indeed 1
I 4330
am 392
quite 1
of 109
your 4
opinion 4
I 4330
was 93
never 3
more 11
annoyed 1
The 193
insipidity 2
and 51
yet 4
the 193
nothingness 2
and 51
yet 4
the 193
of 109
all 162
those 1
people 4
What 14
would 5
I 4330
give 15
to 806
hear 76
your 4
strictures 1
on 86
them 9
Your 4
conjecture 4
is 124
totally 1
wrong 24
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
My 90
mind 25
was 93
more 11
agreeably 1
engaged 1
I 4330
have 11
been 1
meditating 1
on 86
the 193
very 1
great 12
pleasure 5
which 2
a 6799
pair 7
of 109
fine 17
eyes 8
in 2719
the 193
face 19
of 109
a 6799
pretty 3
woman 21
can 287
bestow 7
Miss 71
immediately 1
fixed 2
her 181
eyes 8
on 86
his 43
face 19
and 51
desired 1
he 962
would 5
tell 16
her 181
what 14
lady 18
had 11
the 193
credit 12
of 109
inspiring 1
such 2
reflections 1
Mr 5
Darcy 2
replied 1
with 34
great 12
intrepidity 2
Miss 71
Elizabeth 5
Bennet 1
Miss 71
Elizabeth 5
Bennet 1
repeated 2
Miss 71
I 4330
am 392
all 162
astonishment 2
How 27
long 49
has 41
she 199
been 1
such 2
a 6799
pray 9
when 6
am 392
I 4330
to 806
wish 13
you 29
joy 36
That 11
is 124
exactly 1
the 193
question 16
which 2
I 4330
expected 1
you 29
to 806
ask 6
A 6799
lady's 1
imagination 3
is 124
very 1
rapid 10
it 67
jumps 4
from 2
admiration 2
to 806
love 29
from 2
love 29
to 806
matrimony 2
in 2719
a 6799
moment 14
I 4330
knew 1
you 29
would 5
be 1200
wishing 1
me 1041
joy 36
Nay 6
if 8
you 29
are 12
serious 4
about 1
it 67
I 4330
shall 12
consider 13
the 193
matter 7
is 124
absolutely 1
settled 1
You 29
will 39
be 1200
having 1
a 6799
charming 2
indeed 1
and 51
of 109
course 10
she 199
will 39
always 1
be 1200
at 272
with 34
you 29
He 962
listened 1
to 806
her 181
with 34
perfect 24
indifference 2
while 4
she 199
chose 2
to 806
entertain 12
herself 1
in 2719
this 6
manner 8
and 51
as 509
his 43
composure 2
convinced 1
her 181
that 11
all 162
was 93
safe 20
her 181
wit 77
flowed 1
long 49
Chapter 3
Mr 5
property 2
consisted 1
almost 1
entirely 1
in 2719
an 970
estate 3
of 109
two 14
thousand 7
a 6799
year 19
which 2
unfortunately 1
for 484
his 43
daughters 1
was 93
entailed 1
in 2719
default 8
of 109
heirs 1
male 21
on 86
a 6799
distant 2
relation 7
and 51
their 2
mother's 1
fortune 8
though 12
ample 3
for 484
her 181
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
could 2
but 82
ill 84
supply 3
the 193
deficiency 2
of 109
his 43
Her 181
father 12
had 11
been 1
an 970
attorney 3
in 2719
and 51
had 11
left 19
her 181
four 26
thousand 7
pounds 1
She 199
had 11
a 6799
sister 9
married 3
to 806
a 6799
Mr 5
Phillips 1
who 79
had 11
been 1
a 6799
clerk 7
to 806
their 2
father 12
and 51
succeeded 1
him 9
in 2719
the 193
business 13
and 51
a 6799
brother 9
settled 1
in 2719
London 5
in 2719
a 6799
respectable 1
line 36
of 109
trade 20
The 193
village 6
of 109
was 93
only 1
one 19
mile 15
from 2
a 6799
most 3
convenient 2
distance 4
for 484
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
who 79
were 5
usually 1
tempted 1
thither 1
three 12
or 333
four 26
times 10
a 6799
week 20
to 806
pay 52
their 2
duty 2
to 806
their 2
aunt 6
and 51
to 806
a 6799
milliner's 1
shop 33
just 24
over 596
the 193
way 27
The 193
two 14
youngest 1
of 109
the 193
family 2
Catherine 2
and 51
Lydia 4
were 5
particularly 1
frequent 9
in 2719
these 4
attentions 1
their 2
minds 4
were 5
more 11
vacant 2
than 22
their 2
and 51
when 6
nothing 5
better 7
offered 1
a 6799
walk 25
to 806
was 93
necessary 2
to 806
amuse 6
their 2
morning 3
hours 1
and 51
furnish 6
conversation 8
for 484
the 193
evening 3
and 51
however 1
bare 19
of 109
news 71
the 193
country 12
in 2719
general 22
might 9
be 1200
they 5
always 1
contrived 1
to 806
learn 9
some 30
from 2
their 2
aunt 6
At 272
present 20
indeed 1
they 5
were 5
well 24
supplied 1
both 8
with 34
news 71
and 51
happiness 2
by 57
the 193
recent 6
arrival 3
of 109
a 6799
militia 6
regiment 8
in 2719
the 193
it 67
was 93
to 806
remain 9
the 193
whole 26
winter 13
and 51
was 93
the 193
headquarters 2
Their 2
visits 1
to 806
Mrs 1
Phillips 1
were 5
now 10
productive 4
of 109
the 193
most 3
interesting 2
intelligence 2
Every 10
day 27
added 1
something 3
to 806
their 2
knowledge 4
of 109
the 193
names 4
and 51
connections 1
Their 2
lodgings 2
were 5
not 85
long 49
a 6799
secret 25
and 51
at 272
length 14
they 5
began 1
to 806
know 12
the 193
officers 1
themselves 1
Mr 5
Phillips 1
visited 1
them 9
all 162
and 51
this 6
opened 1
to 806
his 43
nieces 1
a 6799
store 16
of 109
felicity 2
unknown 3
before 2
They 5
could 2
talk 18
of 109
nothing 5
but 82
officers 1
and 51
Mr 5
large 11
fortune 8
the 193
mention 5
of 109
which 2
gave 4
animation 3
to 806
their 2
mother 21
was 93
worthless 4
in 2719
their 2
eyes 8
when 6
opposed 1
to 806
the 193
of 109
an 970
ensign 3
After 48
listening 1
one 19
morning 3
to 806
their 2
effusions 1
on 86
this 6
subject 11
Mr 5
Bennet 1
coolly 1
observed 1
From 2
all 162
that 11
I 4330
can 287
collect 30
by 57
your 4
manner 8
of 109
talking 1
you 29
must 28
be 1200
two 14
of 109
the 193
silliest 1
girls 1
in 2719
the 193
country 12
I 4330
have 11
suspected 1
it 67
some 30
time 45
but 82
I 4330
am 392
now 10
convinced 1
Catherine 2
was 93
disconcerted 1
and 51
made 13
no 896
answer 8
but 82
Lydia 4
with 34
perfect 24
indifference 2
continued 1
to 806
express 25
her 181
admiration 2
of 109
Captain 8
Carter 3
and 51
her 181
hope 16
of 109
seeing 2
him 9
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
the 193
day 27
as 509
he 962
was 93
going 3
the 193
next 2
morning 3
to 806
London 5
I 4330
am 392
astonished 1
my 90
dear 15
said 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
that 11
you 29
should 7
be 1200
so 797
ready 2
to 806
think 8
your 4
own 9
children 1
silly 2
If 8
I 4330
wished 1
to 806
think 8
of 109
anybody's 1
children 1
it 67
should 7
not 85
be 1200
of 109
my 90
own 9
however 1
If 8
my 90
children 1
are 12
silly 2
I 4330
must 28
hope 16
to 806
be 1200
always 1
sensible 3
of 109
it 67
as 509
it 67
happens 4
they 5
are 12
all 162
of 109
them 9
very 1
clever 6
This 6
is 124
the 193
only 1
point 22
I 4330
flatter 10
myself 1
on 86
which 2
we 444
do 814
not 85
agree 11
I 4330
had 11
hoped 1
that 11
our 3
sentiments 1
coincided 1
in 2719
every 10
particular 13
but 82
I 4330
must 28
so 797
far 91
differ 18
from 2
you 29
as 509
to 806
think 8
our 3
two 14
youngest 1
daughters 1
uncommonly 1
foolish 4
My 90
dear 15
Mr 5
Bennet 1
you 29
must 28
not 85
expect 20
such 2
girls 1
to 806
have 11
the 193
sense 8
of 109
their 2
father 12
and 51
mother 21
When 6
they 5
get 13
to 806
our 3
age 24
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
they 5
will 39
not 85
think 8
about 1
officers 1
any 17
more 11
than 22
we 444
do 814
I 4330
remember 4
the 193
time 45
when 6
I 4330
liked 1
a 6799
red 211
coat 12
myself 1
very 1
indeed 1
so 797
I 4330
do 814
still 13
at 272
my 90
heart 57
and 51
if 8
a 6799
smart 20
young 9
colonel 5
with 34
five 5
or 333
six 24
thousand 7
a 6799
year 19
should 7
want 13
one 19
of 109
my 90
girls 1
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
say 7
nay 6
to 806
him 9
and 51
I 4330
thought 11
Colonel 5
Forster 1
looked 1
very 1
becoming 2
the 193
other 5
night 61
at 272
Sir 22
in 2719
his 43
Mamma 9
cried 1
Lydia 4
my 90
aunt 6
says 1
that 11
Colonel 5
Forster 1
and 51
Captain 8
Carter 3
do 814
not 85
go 501
so 797
often 4
to 806
Miss 71
as 509
they 5
did 23
when 6
they 5
first 8
came 36
she 199
sees 6
them 9
now 10
very 1
often 4
standing 3
in 2719
Clarke's 1
library 2
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
was 93
prevented 1
replying 1
by 57
the 193
entrance 6
of 109
the 193
footman 2
with 34
a 6799
note 16
for 484
Miss 71
Bennet 1
it 67
came 36
from 2
and 51
the 193
servant 3
waited 1
for 484
an 970
answer 8
Mrs 1
eyes 8
sparkled 1
with 34
pleasure 5
and 51
she 199
was 93
eagerly 1
calling 3
out 365
while 4
her 181
daughter 4
read 49
Well 24
Jane 8
who 79
is 124
it 67
from 2
What 14
is 124
it 67
about 1
What 14
does 5
he 962
say 7
Well 24
Jane 8
make 17
haste 8
and 51

us 70
make 17
haste 8
my 90
love 29
It 67
is 124
from 2
Miss 71
said 1
Jane 8
and 51
then 5
read 49
it 67
aloud 1
MY 90
DEAR 15
FRIEND 14
If 8
you 29
are 12
not 85
so 797
compassionate 2
as 509
to 806
dine 9
with 34
Louisa 2
and 51
me 1041
we 444
shall 12
be 1200
in 2719
danger 7
of 109
hating 1
each 1
other 5
for 484
the 193
rest 110
of 109
our 3
lives 4
for 484
a 6799
whole 26
day's 1
between 1
two 14
women 5
can 287
never 3
end 92
without 1
a 6799
quarrel 11
Come 36
as 509
soon 3
as 509
you 29
can 287
on 86
receipt 5
of 109
this 6
My 90
brother 9
and 51
the 193
gentlemen 1
are 12
to 806
dine 9
with 34
the 193
officers 1
ever 33
CAROLINE 1
With 34
the 193
officers 1
cried 1
Lydia 4
I 4330
wonder 17
my 90
aunt 6
did 23
not 85
tell 16
us 70
of 109
Dining 1
out 365
said 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
that 11
is 124
very 1
unlucky 1
Can 287
I 4330
have 11
the 193
carriage 5
said 1
Jane 8
No 896
my 90
dear 15
you 29
had 11
better 7
go 501
on 86
horseback 2
because 1
it 67
seems 1
likely 1
to 806
rain 31
and 51
then 5
you 29
must 28
stay 7
all 162
night 61
That 11
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
good 29
scheme 7
said 1
Elizabeth 5
if 8
you 29
were 5
sure 11
that 11
they 5
would 5
not 85
offer 10
to 806
send 10
her 181
home 90
Oh 17
but 82
the 193
gentlemen 1
will 39
have 11
Mr 5
chaise 3
to 806
go 501
to 806
and 51
the 193
have 11
no 896
horses 7
to 806
theirs 1
I 4330
had 11
much 2
rather 2
go 501
in 2719
the 193
coach 11
But 82
my 90
dear 15
your 4
father 12
cannot 1
spare 11
the 193
horses 7
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
They 5
are 12
wanted 1
in 2719
the 193
farm 25
Mr 5
Bennet 1
are 12
they 5
not 85
They 5
are 12
wanted 1
in 2719
the 193
farm 25
much 2
oftener 1
than 22
I 4330
can 287
get 13
them 9
But 82
if 8
you 29
have 11
got 14
them 9
said 1
Elizabeth 5
my 90
mother's 1
purpose 12
will 39
be 1200
answered 1
She 199
did 23
at 272
last 7
extort 14
from 2
her 181
father 12
an 970
acknowledgment 3
that 11
the 193
horses 7
were 5
engaged 1
Jane 8
was 93
therefore 1
obliged 1
to 806
go 501
on 86
horseback 2
and 51
her 181
mother 21
attended 1
her 181
to 806
the 193
door 41
with 34
many 2
cheerful 6
prognostics 1
of 109
a 6799
bad 33
day 27
Her 181
hopes 1
were 5
answered 1
Jane 8
had 11
not 85
been 1
gone 4
long 49
before 2
it 67
rained 1
hard 70
Her 181
sisters 1
were 5
uneasy 1
for 484
her 181
but 82
her 181
mother 21
was 93
delighted 2
The 193
rain 31
continued 1
the 193
whole 26
evening 3
without 1
intermission 3
Jane 8
certainly 1
could 2
not 85
come 36
back 182
This 6
was 93
a 6799
lucky 1
idea 21
of 109
mine 26
indeed 1
said 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
more 11
than 22
once 2
as 509
if 8
the 193
credit 12
of 109
making 4
it 67
rain 31
were 5
all 162
her 181
own 9
Till 14
the 193
next 2
morning 3
however 1
she 199
was 93
not 85
aware 3
of 109
all 162
the 193
felicity 2
of 109
her 181
contrivance 3
Breakfast 5
was 93
scarcely 1
over 596
when 6
a 6799
servant 3
from 2
brought 1
the 193
following 3
note 16
for 484
Elizabeth 5
MY 90
DEAREST 2
LIZZY 2
I 4330
find 10
myself 1
very 1
unwell 1
this 6
morning 3
which 2
I 4330
suppose 4
is 124
to 806
be 1200
imputed 1
to 806
my 90
getting 1
wet 19
through 4
yesterday 3
My 90
kind 31
friends 4
will 39
not 85
hear 76
of 109
my 90
returning 1
till 14
I 4330
am 392
better 7
They 5
insist 9
also 3
on 86
my 90
seeing 2
Mr 5
do 814
not 85
be 1200
alarmed 1
if 8
you 29
should 7
hear 76
of 109
his 43
having 1
been 1
to 806
excepting 1
a 6799
sore 11
throat 9
and 51
headache 3
there 21
is 124
not 85
much 2
the 193
matter 7
with 34
me 1041
etc 10
Well 24
my 90
dear 15
said 1
Mr 5
Bennet 1
when 6
Elizabeth 5
had 11
read 49
the 193
note 16
aloud 1
if 8
your 4
daughter 4
should 7
have 11
a 6799
dangerous 2
fit 28
of 109
she 199
should 7
die 38
it 67
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
comfort 14
to 806
know 12
that 11
it 67
was 93
all 162
in 2719
pursuit 3
of 109
Mr 5
and 51
under 288
your 4
orders 1
Oh 17
I 4330
am 392
not 85
afraid 1
of 109
her 181
dying 2
People 4
do 814
not 85
die 38
of 109
little 6
trifling 1
colds 1
She 199
will 39
be 1200
taken 1
good 29
care 47
of 109
As 509
long 49
as 509
she 199
stays 1
there 21
it 67
is 124
all 162
very 1
well 24
I 4330
would 5
go 501
and 51
see 70
her 181
if 8
I 4330
could 2
have 11
the 193
carriage 5
Elizabeth 5
feeling 4
really 1
anxious 4
was 93
determined 2
to 806
go 501
to 806
her 181
though 12
the 193
carriage 5
was 93
not 85
to 806
be 1200
had 11
and 51
as 509
she 199
was 93
no 896
horsewoman 2
walking 2
was 93
her 181
only 1
alternative 4
She 199
declared 1
her 181
resolution 3
How 27
can 287
you 29
be 1200
so 797
silly 2
cried 1
her 181
mother 21
as 509
to 806
think 8
of 109
such 2
a 6799
thing 15
in 2719
all 162
this 6
dirt 13
You 29
will 39
not 85
be 1200
fit 28
to 806
be 1200
seen 1
when 6
you 29
get 13
there 21
I 4330
shall 12
be 1200
very 1
fit 28
to 806
see 70
is 124
all 162
I 4330
want 13
Is 124
this 6
a 6799
hint 13
to 806
me 1041
Lizzy 2
said 1
her 181
father 12
to 806
send 10
for 484
the 193
horses 7
No 896
indeed 1
I 4330
do 814
not 85
wish 13
to 806
avoid 8
the 193
walk 25
The 193
distance 4
is 124
nothing 5
when 6
one 19
has 41
a 6799
motive 4
only 1
three 12
miles 4
I 4330
shall 12
be 1200
back 182
by 57
dinner 9
I 4330
admire 6
the 193
activity 2
of 109
your 4
benevolence 3
observed 1
Mary 13
but 82
every 10
impulse 4
of 109
feeling 4
should 7
be 1200
guided 1
by 57
reason 13
and 51
in 2719
my 90
opinion 4
exertion 3
should 7
always 1
be 1200
in 2719
proportion 11
to 806
what 14
is 124
required 1
We 444
will 39
go 501
as 509
far 91
as 509
with 34
you 29
said 1
Catherine 2
and 51
Lydia 4
Elizabeth 5
accepted 1
their 2
company 2
and 51
the 193
three 12
young 9
ladies 1
set 40
off 100
together 3
If 8
we 444
make 17
haste 8
said 1
Lydia 4
as 509
they 5
walked 1
along 3
perhaps 1
we 444
may 49
see 70
something 3
of 109
Captain 8
Carter 3
before 2
he 962
goes 1
In 2719
they 5
parted 1
the 193
two 14
youngest 1
repaired 1
to 806
the 193
lodgings 2
of 109
one 19
of 109
the 193
wives 1
and 51
Elizabeth 5
continued 1
her 181
walk 25
alone 1
crossing 3
field 15
after 48
field 15
at 272
a 6799
quick 25
pace 14
jumping 1
over 596
stiles 1
and 51
springing 1
over 596
puddles 1
with 34
impatient 2
activity 2
and 51
finding 4
herself 1
at 272
last 7
within 3
view 18
of 109
the 193
house 87
with 34
weary 2
ankles 1
dirty 2
stockings 1
and 51
a 6799
face 19
glowing 2
with 34
the 193
warmth 2
of 109
exercise 7
She 199
was 93
shown 1
into 26
the 193
where 21
all 162
but 82
Jane 8
were 5
assembled 1
and 51
where 21
her 181
appearance 3
created 1
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
surprise 4
That 11
she 199
should 7
have 11
walked 1
three 12
miles 4
so 797
early 1
in 2719
the 193
day 27
in 2719
such 2
dirty 2
weather 33
and 51
by 57
herself 1
was 93
almost 1
incredible 1
to 806
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
and 51
Miss 71
and 51
Elizabeth 5
was 93
convinced 1
that 11
they 5
held 1
her 181
in 2719
contempt 8
for 484
it 67
She 199
was 93
received 1
however 1
very 1
politely 1
by 57
them 9
and 51
in 2719
their 2
brother's 1
manners 1
there 21
was 93
something 3
better 7
than 22
politeness 2
there 21
was 93
good 29
and 51
kindness 3
Mr 5
Darcy 2
said 1
very 1
little 6
and 51
Mr 5
Hurst 2
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
The 193
former 3
was 93
divided 1
between 1
admiration 2
of 109
the 193
brilliancy 2
which 2
exercise 7
had 11
given 3
to 806
her 181
complexion 5
and 51
doubt 15
as 509
to 806
the 193
occasion's 1
justifying 1
her 181
coming 3
so 797
far 91
alone 1
The 193
latter 3
was 93
thinking 2
only 1
of 109
his 43
breakfast 5
Her 181
inquiries 1
after 48
her 181
sister 9
were 5
not 85
very 1
answered 1
Miss 71
Bennet 1
had 11
slept 1
ill 84
and 51
though 12
up 194
was 93
very 1
feverish 4
and 51
not 85
well 24
enough 2
to 806
leave 14
her 181
room 22
Elizabeth 5
was 93
glad 30
to 806
be 1200
taken 1
to 806
her 181
immediately 1
and 51
Jane 8
who 79
had 11
only 1
been 1
withheld 1
by 57
the 193
fear 14
of 109
giving 2
alarm 9
or 333
inconvenience 4
from 2
expressing 1
in 2719
her 181
note 16
how 27
much 2
she 199
longed 1
for 484
such 2
a 6799
visit 14
was 93
delighted 2
at 272
her 181
entrance 6
She 199
was 93
not 85
equal 17
however 1
to 806
much 2
conversation 8
and 51
when 6
Miss 71
left 19
them 9
together 3
could 2
attempt 5
little 6
besides 1
expressions 1
of 109
gratitude 2
for 484
the 193
extraordinary 1
kindness 3
she 199
was 93
treated 1
with 34
Elizabeth 5
silently 1
attended 1
her 181
When 6
breakfast 5
was 93
over 596
they 5
were 5
joined 1
by 57
the 193
sisters 1
and 51
Elizabeth 5
began 1
to 806
like 22
them 9
herself 1
when 6
she 199
saw 24
how 27
much 2
affection 5
and 51
solicitude 2
they 5
showed 1
for 484
Jane 8
The 193
apothecary 2
came 36
and 51
having 1
examined 1
his 43
patient 6
said 1
as 509
might 9
be 1200
supposed 2
that 11
she 199
had 11
caught 1
a 6799
violent 2
cold 9
and 51
that 11
they 5
must 28
to 806
get 13
the 193
better 7
of 109
it 67
advised 2
her 181
to 806
return 14
to 806
bed 93
and 51
promised 1
her 181
some 30
The 193
advice 2
was 93
followed 1
readily 1
for 484
the 193
feverish 4
symptoms 1
increased 1
and 51
her 181
head 140
ached 1
acutely 1
Elizabeth 5
did 23
not 85
quit 14
her 181
room 22
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
nor 102
were 5
the 193
other 5
ladies 1
often 4
absent 14
the 193
gentlemen 1
being 3
out 365
they 5
had 11
in 2719
fact 35
nothing 5
to 806
do 814
elsewhere 1
When 6
the 193
clock 9
struck 1
three 12
Elizabeth 5
felt 5
that 11
she 199
must 28
go 501
and 51
very 1
unwillingly 1
said 1
so 797
Miss 71
offered 1
her 181
the 193
carriage 5
and 51
she 199
only 1
wanted 1
a 6799
little 6
pressing 4
to 806
accept 16
it 67
when 6
Jane 8
testified 1
such 2
concern 6
in 2719
parting 3
with 34
her 181
that 11
Miss 71
was 93
obliged 1
to 806
convert 13
the 193
offer 10
of 109
the 193
chaise 3
to 806
an 970
invitation 6
to 806
remain 9
at 272
for 484
the 193
present 20
Elizabeth 5
most 3
thankfully 1
consented 1
and 51
a 6799
servant 3
was 93
dispatched 1
to 806
to 806
acquaint 9
the 193
family 2
with 34
her 181
stay 7
and 51
bring 6
back 182
a 6799
supply 3
of 109
clothes 10
Chapter 3
At 272
five 5
o'clock 1
the 193
two 14
ladies 1
retired 1
to 806
dress 22
and 51
at 272
six 24
Elizabeth 5
was 93
summoned 1
to 806
dinner 9
To 806
the 193
civil 15
inquiries 1
which 2
then 5
poured 1
in 2719
and 51
which 2
she 199
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
distinguishing 1
the 193
much 2
superior 5
solicitude 2
of 109
Mr 5
she 199
could 2
not 85
make 17
a 6799
very 1
answer 8
Jane 8
was 93
by 57
no 896
means 1
better 7
The 193
sisters 1
on 86
hearing 3
this 6
repeated 2
three 12
or 333
four 26
times 10
how 27
much 2
they 5
were 5
grieved 1
how 27
shocking 2
it 67
was 93
to 806
have 11
a 6799
bad 33
cold 9
and 51
how 27
excessively 1
they 5
disliked 1
being 3
ill 84
themselves 1
and 51
then 5
thought 11
no 896
more 11
of 109
the 193
matter 7
and 51
their 2
indifference 2
towards 1
Jane 8
when 6
not 85
immediately 1
before 2
them 9
restored 1
Elizabeth 5
to 806
the 193
enjoyment 3
of 109
all 162
her 181
former 3
dislike 4
Their 2
brother 9
indeed 1
was 93
the 193
only 1
one 19
of 109
the 193
party 3
whom 3
she 199
could 2
regard 7
with 34
any 17
complacency 2
His 43
anxiety 2
for 484
Jane 8
was 93
evident 2
and 51
his 43
attentions 1
to 806
herself 1
most 3
pleasing 3
and 51
they 5
prevented 1
her 181
feeling 4
herself 1
so 797
much 2
an 970
intruder 3
as 509
she 199
believed 1
she 199
was 93
considered 1
by 57
the 193
others 1
She 199
had 11
very 1
little 6
notice 8
from 2
any 17
but 82
him 9
Miss 71
was 93
engrossed 1
by 57
Mr 5
Darcy 2
her 181
sister 9
scarcely 1
less 19
so 797
and 51
as 509
for 484
Mr 5
Hurst 2
by 57
whom 3
Elizabeth 5
sat 92
he 962
was 93
an 970
indolent 2
man 343
who 79
lived 1
only 1
to 806
eat 15
drink 9
and 51
play 73
at 272
cards 7
who 79
when 6
he 962
found 18
her 181
to 806
prefer 13
a 6799
plain 27
dish 52
to 806
a 6799
ragout 3
had 11
nothing 5
to 806
say 7
to 806
her 181
When 6
dinner 9
was 93
over 596
she 199
returned 1
directly 1
to 806
Jane 8
and 51
Miss 71
began 1
abusing 1
her 181
as 509
soon 3
as 509
she 199
was 93
out 365
of 109
the 193
room 22
Her 181
manners 1
were 5
pronounced 1
to 806
be 1200
very 1
bad 33
indeed 1
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
pride 6
and 51
impertinence 3
she 199
had 11
no 896
conversation 8
no 896
style 4
no 896
beauty 2
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
thought 11
the 193
same 5
and 51
added 1
She 199
has 41
nothing 5
in 2719
short 62
to 806
recommend 8
her 181
but 82
being 3
an 970
excellent 2
walker 3
I 4330
shall 12
never 3
forget 8
her 181
appearance 3
this 6
morning 3
She 199
really 1
looked 1
almost 1
wild 36
She 199
did 23
indeed 1
Louisa 2
I 4330
could 2
hardly 1
keep 11
my 90
countenance 4
Very 1
nonsensical 2
to 806
come 36
at 272
all 162
Why 4
must 28
be 1200
scampering 1
about 1
the 193
country 12
because 1
her 181
sister 9
had 11
a 6799
cold 9
Her 181
hair 71
so 797
untidy 1
so 797
Yes 16
and 51
her 181
petticoat 3
I 4330
hope 16
you 29
saw 24
her 181
petticoat 3
six 24
inches 1
deep 12
in 2719
mud 38
I 4330
am 392
absolutely 1
certain 5
and 51
the 193
gown 5
which 2
had 11
been 1
let 50
down 90
to 806
hide 18
it 67
not 85
doing 3
its 2
office 11
Your 4
picture 8
may 49
be 1200
very 1
exact 14
Louisa 2
said 1
but 82
this 6
was 93
all 162
lost 1
upon 1
me 1041
I 4330
thought 11
Miss 71
Elizabeth 5
Bennet 1
looked 1
remarkably 1
well 24
when 6
she 199
came 36
into 26
the 193
room 22
this 6
morning 3
Her 181
dirty 2
petticoat 3
quite 1
escaped 1
my 90
notice 8
_You_ 1
observed 1
it 67
Mr 5
Darcy 2
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
said 1
Miss 71
and 51
I 4330
am 392
inclined 1
to 806
think 8
that 11
you 29
would 5
not 85
wish 13
to 806
see 70
make 17
such 2
an 970
exhibition 8
Certainly 1
not 85
To 806
walk 25
three 12
miles 4
or 333
four 26
miles 4
or 333
five 5
miles 4
or 333
whatever 1
it 67
is 124
above 3
her 181
ankles 1
in 2719
dirt 13
and 51
alone 1
quite 1
alone 1
What 14
could 2
she 199
mean 36
by 57
it 67
It 67
seems 1
to 806
me 1041
to 806
show 64
an 970
abominable 1
sort 14
of 109
conceited 4
independence 2
a 6799
most 3
indifference 2
to 806
decorum 2
It 67
shows 5
an 970
affection 5
for 484
her 181
sister 9
that 11
is 124
very 1
pleasing 3
said 1
I 4330
am 392
afraid 1
Mr 5
Darcy 2
observed 1
Miss 71
in 2719
a 6799
half 23
whisper 8
that 11
this 6
adventure 11
has 41
rather 2
affected 2
your 4
admiration 2
of 109
her 181
fine 17
eyes 8
Not 85
at 272
all 162
he 962
replied 1
they 5
were 5
brightened 1
by 57
the 193
exercise 7
A 6799
short 62
pause 4
followed 1
this 6
speech 13
and 51
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
began 1
again 2
I 4330
have 11
an 970
excessive 2
regard 7
for 484
Miss 71
Jane 8
Bennet 1
she 199
is 124
really 1
a 6799
very 1
sweet 33
girl 14
and 51
I 4330
wish 13
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
she 199
were 5
well 24
settled 1
But 82
with 34
such 2
a 6799
father 12
and 51
mother 21
and 51
such 2
low 46
connections 1
I 4330
am 392
afraid 1
there 21
is 124
no 896
chance 20
of 109
it 67
I 4330
think 8
I 4330
have 11
heard 1
you 29
say 7
that 11
their 2
uncle 18
is 124
an 970
attorney 3
in 2719
Yes 16
and 51
they 5
have 11
another 1
who 79
lives 4
somewhere 1
near 15
That 11
is 124
capital 17
added 1
her 181
sister 9
and 51
they 5
both 8
laughed 1
heartily 1
If 8
they 5
had 11
uncles 1
enough 2
to 806
fill 25
cried 1
it 67
would 5
not 85
make 17
them 9
one 19
jot 10
less 19
agreeable 3
But 82
it 67
must 28
very 1
materially 1
lessen 4
their 2
chance 20
of 109
marrying 1
men 140
of 109
any 17
consideration 3
in 2719
the 193
world 12
replied 1
Darcy 2
To 806
this 6
speech 13
made 13
no 896
answer 8
but 82
his 43
sisters 1
gave 4
it 67
their 2
hearty 2
assent 5
and 51
indulged 1
their 2
mirth 8
for 484
some 30
time 45
at 272
the 193
expense 3
of 109
their 2
dear 15
friend's 1
vulgar 22
relations 4
With 34
a 6799
renewal 3
of 109
tenderness 2
however 1
they 5
returned 1
to 806
her 181
room 22
on 86
leaving 3
the 193
and 51
sat 92
with 34
her 181
till 14
summoned 1
to 806
coffee 15
She 199
was 93
still 13
very 1
poorly 1
and 51
Elizabeth 5
would 5
not 85
quit 14
her 181
at 272
all 162
till 14
late 23
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
when 6
she 199
had 11
the 193
comfort 14
of 109
seeing 2
her 181
sleep 33
and 51
when 6
it 67
seemed 1
to 806
her 181
rather 2
right 31
than 22
pleasant 9
that 11
she 199
should 7
go 501
downstairs 2
herself 1
On 86
entering 1
the 193
she 199
found 18
the 193
whole 26
party 3
at 272
loo 65
and 51
was 93
immediately 1
invited 1
to 806
join 16
them 9
but 82
suspecting 1
them 9
to 806
be 1200
playing 1
high 54
she 199
declined 1
it 67
and 51
making 4
her 181
sister 9
the 193
excuse 4
said 1
she 199
would 5
amuse 6
herself 1
for 484
the 193
short 62
time 45
she 199
could 2
stay 7
below 1
with 34
a 6799
book 69
Mr 5
Hurst 2
looked 1
at 272
her 181
with 34
astonishment 2
Do 814
you 29
prefer 13
reading 3
to 806
cards 7
said 1
he 962
that 11
is 124
rather 2
singular 7
Miss 71
Eliza 7
Bennet 1
said 1
Miss 71
despises 1
cards 7
She 199
is 124
a 6799
great 12
reader 6
and 51
has 41
no 896
pleasure 5
in 2719
anything 3
else 2
I 4330
deserve 4
neither 1
such 2
praise 7
nor 102
such 2
censure 7
cried 1
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
am 392
a 6799
great 12
reader 6
and 51
I 4330
have 11
pleasure 5
in 2719
many 2
things 1
In 2719
nursing 2
your 4
sister 9
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
have 11
pleasure 5
said 1
and 51
I 4330
hope 16
it 67
will 39
be 1200
soon 3
increased 1
by 57
seeing 2
her 181
quite 1
well 24
Elizabeth 5
thanked 1
him 9
from 2
her 181
heart 57
and 51
then 5
walked 1
towards 1
the 193
table 27
where 21
a 6799
few 6
books 15
were 5
lying 2
He 962
immediately 1
offered 1
to 806
fetch 8
her 181
that 11
his 43
library 2
afforded 1
And 51
I 4330
wish 13
my 90
collection 3
were 5
larger 1
for 484
your 4
benefit 5
and 51
my 90
own 9
credit 12
but 82
I 4330
am 392
an 970
idle 10
fellow 9
and 51
though 12
I 4330
have 11
not 85
many 2
I 4330
have 11
more 11
than 22
I 4330
ever 33
looked 1
into 26
Elizabeth 5
assured 4
him 9
that 11
she 199
could 2
suit 21
herself 1
perfectly 1
with 34
those 1
in 2719
the 193
room 22
I 4330
am 392
astonished 1
said 1
Miss 71
that 11
my 90
father 12
should 7
have 11
left 19
so 797
small 14
a 6799
collection 3
of 109
books 15
What 14
a 6799
delightful 2
library 2
you 29
have 11
at 272
Mr 5
Darcy 2
It 67
ought 2
to 806
be 1200
good 29
he 962
replied 1
it 67
has 41
been 1
the 193
work 87
of 109
many 2
generations 1
And 51
then 5
you 29
have 11
added 1
so 797
much 2
to 806
it 67
yourself 1
you 29
are 12
always 1
buying 1
books 15
I 4330
cannot 1
comprehend 4
the 193
neglect 9
of 109
a 6799
family 2
library 2
in 2719
such 2
days 1
as 509
these 4
Neglect 9
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
neglect 9
nothing 5
that 11
can 287
add 54
to 806
the 193
beauties 1
of 109
that 11
noble 13
place 29
Charles 5
when 6
you 29
build 12
house 87
I 4330
wish 13
it 67
may 49
be 1200
half 23
as 509
delightful 2
as 509
I 4330
wish 13
it 67
may 49
But 82
I 4330
would 5
really 1
advise 9
you 29
to 806
make 17
your 4
purchase 7
in 2719
that 11
and 51
take 18
for 484
a 6799
kind 31
of 109
model 10
There 21
is 124
not 85
a 6799
finer 3
county 3
in 2719
England 2
than 22
With 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
I 4330
will 39
buy 13
itself 1
if 8
Darcy 2
will 39
sell 15
it 67
I 4330
am 392
talking 1
of 109
possibilities 1
Charles 5
Upon 1
my 90
word 26
Caroline 1
I 4330
should 7
think 8
it 67
more 11
possible 3
to 806
get 13
by 57
purchase 7
than 22
by 57
imitation 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
so 797
much 2
caught 1
with 34
what 14
passed 1
as 509
to 806
leave 14
her 181
very 1
little 6
attention 3
for 484
her 181
book 69
and 51
soon 3
laying 1
it 67
wholly 1
aside 3
she 199
drew 2
near 15
the 193
and 51
stationed 1
herself 1
between 1
Mr 5
and 51
his 43
eldest 1
sister 9
to 806
observe 6
the 193
game 24
Is 124
Miss 71
Darcy 2
much 2
grown 5
since 7
the 193
spring 23
said 1
Miss 71
will 39
she 199
be 1200
as 509
tall 35
as 509
I 4330
am 392
I 4330
think 8
she 199
will 39
She 199
is 124
now 10
about 1
Miss 71
Elizabeth 5
height 7
or 333
rather 2
taller 1
How 27
I 4330
long 49
to 806
see 70
her 181
again 2
I 4330
never 3
met 180
with 34
anybody 2
who 79
delighted 2
me 1041
so 797
much 2
Such 2
a 6799
countenance 4
such 2
manners 1
And 51
so 797
extremely 1
accomplished 1
for 484
her 181
age 24
Her 181
performance 3
on 86
the 193
pianoforte 3
is 124
exquisite 4
It 67
is 124
amazing 2
to 806
me 1041
said 1
how 27
young 9
ladies 1
can 287
have 11
patience 2
to 806
be 1200
so 797
very 1
accomplished 1
as 509
they 5
all 162
are 12
All 162
young 9
ladies 1
accomplished 1
My 90
dear 15
Charles 5
what 14
do 814
you 29
mean 36
Yes 16
all 162
of 109
them 9
I 4330
think 8
They 5
all 162
paint 19
tables 7
cover 21
screens 1
and 51
net 39
purses 1
I 4330
scarcely 1
know 12
anyone 2
who 79
cannot 1
do 814
all 162
this 6
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
I 4330
never 3
heard 1
a 6799
young 9
lady 18
spoken 1
of 109
for 484
the 193
first 8
time 45
without 1
being 3
informed 1
that 11
she 199
was 93
very 1
accomplished 1
Your 4
list 27
of 109
the 193
common 23
extent 3
of 109
accomplishments 1
said 1
Darcy 2
has 41
too 50
much 2
truth 7
The 193
word 26
is 124
applied 1
to 806
many 2
a 6799
woman 21
who 79
deserves 1
it 67
no 896
otherwise 1
than 22
by 57
netting 2
a 6799
purse 7
or 333
covering 3
a 6799
screen 15
But 82
I 4330
am 392
very 1
far 91
from 2
agreeing 1
with 34
you 29
in 2719
your 4
estimation 3
of 109
ladies 1
in 2719
general 22
I 4330
cannot 1
boast 12
of 109
knowing 3
more 11
than 22
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
range 9
of 109
my 90
acquaintance 5
that 11
are 12
really 1
accomplished 1
Nor 102
I 4330
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
said 1
Miss 71
Then 5
observed 1
Elizabeth 5
you 29
must 28
comprehend 4
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
in 2719
your 4
idea 21
of 109
an 970
accomplished 1
woman 21
Yes 16
I 4330
do 814
comprehend 4
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
in 2719
it 67
Oh 17
certainly 1
cried 1
his 43
faithful 6
assistant 3
no 896
one 19
can 287
be 1200
really 1
esteemed 1
accomplished 1
who 79
does 5
not 85
greatly 1
surpass 4
what 14
is 124
usually 1
met 180
with 34
A 6799
woman 21
must 28
have 11
a 6799
thorough 13
knowledge 4
of 109
music 24
singing 2
drawing 3
dancing 2
and 51
the 193
modern 23
languages 1
to 806
deserve 4
the 193
word 26
and 51
besides 1
all 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
possess 16
a 6799
certain 5
something 3
in 2719
her 181
air 129
and 51
manner 8
of 109
walking 2
the 193
tone 12
of 109
her 181
voice 8
her 181
address 9
and 51
expressions 1
or 333
the 193
word 26
will 39
be 1200
but 82
All 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
possess 16
added 1
Darcy 2
and 51
to 806
all 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
yet 4
add 54
something 3
more 11
substantial 2
in 2719
the 193
improvement 3
of 109
her 181
mind 25
by 57
extensive 4
reading 3
I 4330
am 392
no 896
longer 1
surprised 1
at 272
your 4
knowing 3
six 24
accomplished 1
women 5
I 4330
rather 2
wonder 17
now 10
at 272
your 4
knowing 3
Are 12
you 29
so 797
severe 7
upon 1
your 4
own 9
sex 45
as 509
to 806
doubt 15
the 193
possibility 2
of 109
all 162
this 6
never 3
saw 24
such 2
a 6799
woman 21
never 3
saw 24
such 2
capacity 2
and 51
taste 15
and 51
application 3
and 51
elegance 2
as 509
you 29
describe 6
united 2
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
and 51
Miss 71
both 8
cried 1
out 365
against 1
the 193
injustice 3
of 109
her 181
implied 1
doubt 15
and 51
were 5
both 8
protesting 1
that 11
they 5
knew 1
many 2
women 5
who 79
answered 1
this 6
description 3
when 6
Mr 5
Hurst 2
called 1
them 9
to 806
order 11
with 34
bitter 15
complaints 1
of 109
their 2
inattention 2
to 806
what 14
was 93
going 3
forward 12
As 509
all 162
conversation 8
was 93
thereby 1
at 272
an 970
end 92
Elizabeth 5
soon 3
afterwards 1
left 19
the 193
room 22
Elizabeth 5
Bennet 1
said 1
Miss 71
when 6
the 193
door 41
was 93
closed 1
on 86
her 181
is 124
one 19
of 109
those 1
young 9
ladies 1
who 79
seek 6
to 806
recommend 8
themselves 1
to 806
the 193
other 5
sex 45
by 57
undervaluing 1
their 2
own 9
and 51
with 34
many 2
men 140
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
it 67
succeeds 1
But 82
in 2719
my 90
opinion 4
it 67
is 124
a 6799
paltry 1
device 3
a 6799
very 1
mean 36
art 104
Undoubtedly 1
replied 1
Darcy 2
to 806
whom 3
this 6
remark 9
was 93
chiefly 1
addressed 1
there 21
is 124
a 6799
meanness 2
in 2719
the 193
arts 4
which 2
ladies 1
sometimes 1
condescend 5
to 806
employ 15
for 484
captivation 2
Whatever 1
bears 4
affinity 2
to 806
cunning 7
is 124
despicable 1
Miss 71
was 93
not 85
so 797
entirely 1
satisfied 1
with 34
this 6
reply 3
as 509
to 806
continue 3
the 193
subject 11
Elizabeth 5
joined 1
them 9
again 2
only 1
to 806
say 7
that 11
her 181
sister 9
was 93
worse 6
and 51
that 11
she 199
could 2
not 85
leave 14
her 181
urged 1
Mr 5
Jones 1
being 3
sent 35
for 484
immediately 1
while 4
his 43
sisters 1
convinced 1
that 11
no 896
country 12
advice 2
could 2
be 1200
of 109
any 17
service 13
recommended 1
an 970
express 25
to 806
town 27
for 484
one 19
of 109
the 193
most 3
eminent 2
physicians 1
This 6
she 199
would 5
not 85
hear 76
of 109
but 82
she 199
was 93
not 85
so 797
unwilling 4
to 806
comply 2
with 34
their 2
brother's 1
proposal 3
and 51
it 67
was 93
settled 1
that 11
Mr 5
Jones 1
should 7
be 1200
sent 35
for 484
early 1
in 2719
the 193
morning 3
if 8
Miss 71
Bennet 1
were 5
not 85
decidedly 1
better 7
was 93
quite 1
uncomfortable 1
his 43
sisters 1
declared 1
that 11
they 5
were 5
miserable 3
They 5
solaced 1
their 2
wretchedness 2
however 1
by 57
duets 1
after 48
supper 4
while 4
he 962
could 2
find 10
no 896
better 7
relief 3
to 806
his 43
feelings 1
than 22
by 57
giving 2
his 43
housekeeper 3
directions 1
that 11
every 10
attention 3
might 9
be 1200
paid 1
to 806
the 193
sick 38
lady 18
and 51
her 181
sister 9
Chapter 3
Elizabeth 5
passed 1
the 193
chief 14
of 109
the 193
night 61
in 2719
her 181
sister's 1
room 22
and 51
in 2719
the 193
morning 3
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
being 3
able 3
to 806
send 10
a 6799
tolerable 1
answer 8
to 806
the 193
inquiries 1
which 2
she 199
very 1
early 1
received 1
from 2
Mr 5
by 57
a 6799
housemaid 3
and 51
some 30
time 45
afterwards 1
from 2
the 193
two 14
elegant 2
ladies 1
who 79
waited 1
on 86
his 43
sisters 1
In 2719
spite 10
of 109
this 6
amendment 3
however 1
she 199
requested 1
to 806
have 11
a 6799
note 16
sent 35
to 806
desiring 1
her 181
mother 21
to 806
visit 14
Jane 8
and 51
form 68
her 181
own 9
of 109
her 181
situation 3
The 193
note 16
was 93
immediately 1
dispatched 1
and 51
its 2
contents 1
as 509
quickly 1
complied 1
with 34
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
accompanied 1
by 57
her 181
two 14
youngest 1
girls 1
reached 1
soon 3
after 48
the 193
family 2
breakfast 5
Had 11
she 199
found 18
Jane 8
in 2719
any 17
apparent 2
danger 7
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
would 5
have 11
been 1
very 1
miserable 3
but 82
being 3
satisfied 1
on 86
seeing 2
her 181
that 11
her 181
illness 3
was 93
not 85
alarming 2
she 199
had 11
no 896
wish 13
of 109
her 181
recovering 1
immediately 1
as 509
her 181
restoration 3
to 806
health 12
would 5
probably 1
remove 7
her 181
from 2
She 199
would 5
not 85
listen 9
therefore 1
to 806
her 181
daughter's 1
proposal 3
of 109
being 3
carried 1
home 90
neither 1
did 23
the 193
apothecary 2
who 79
arrived 1
about 1
the 193
same 5
time 45
think 8
it 67
at 272
all 162
advisable 1
After 48
sitting 3
a 6799
little 6
while 4
with 34
Jane 8
on 86
Miss 71
appearance 3
and 51
invitation 6
the 193
mother 21
and 51
three 12
daughters 1
all 162
attended 1
her 181
into 26
the 193
breakfast 5
met 180
them 9
with 34
hopes 1
that 11
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
had 11
not 85
found 18
Miss 71
Bennet 1
worse 6
than 22
she 199
expected 1
Indeed 1
I 4330
have 11
sir 22
was 93
her 181
answer 8
She 199
is 124
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
too 50
ill 84
to 806
be 1200
moved 1
Mr 5
Jones 1
says 1
we 444
must 28
not 85
think 8
of 109
moving 2
her 181
We 444
must 28
trespass 8
a 6799
little 6
longer 1
on 86
your 4
kindness 3
Removed 1
cried 1
It 67
must 28
not 85
be 1200
thought 11
of 109
My 90
sister 9
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
will 39
not 85
hear 76
of 109
her 181
removal 3
You 29
may 49
depend 17
upon 1
it 67
Madam 5
said 1
Miss 71
with 34
cold 9
civility 2
that 11
Miss 71
Bennet 1
will 39
receive 8
every 10
possible 3
attention 3
while 4
she 199
remains 1
with 34
us 70
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
was 93
profuse 4
in 2719
her 181
acknowledgments 1
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
added 1
if 8
it 67
was 93
not 85
for 484
such 2
good 29
friends 4
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
what 14
would 5
become 2
of 109
her 181
for 484
she 199
is 124
very 1
ill 84
indeed 1
and 51
suffers 1
a 6799
vast 8
deal 13
though 12
with 34
the 193
greatest 1
patience 2
in 2719
the 193
world 12
which 2
is 124
always 1
the 193
way 27
with 34
her 181
for 484
she 199
has 41
without 1
exception 6
the 193
sweetest 1
temper 22
I 4330
have 11
ever 33
met 180
with 34
I 4330
often 4
tell 16
my 90
other 5
girls 1
they 5
are 12
nothing 5
to 806
You 29
have 11
a 6799
sweet 33
room 22
here 31
Mr 5
and 51
a 6799
charming 2
prospect 13
over 596
the 193
gravel 7
walk 25
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
a 6799
place 29
in 2719
the 193
country 12
that 11
is 124
equal 17
to 806
You 29
will 39
not 85
think 8
of 109
quitting 1
it 67
in 2719
a 6799
hurry 3
I 4330
hope 16
though 12
you 29
have 11
but 82
a 6799
short 62
lease 16
Whatever 1
I 4330
do 814
is 124
done 3
in 2719
a 6799
hurry 3
replied 1
he 962
and 51
therefore 1
if 8
I 4330
should 7
resolve 5
to 806
quit 14
I 4330
should 7
probably 1
be 1200
off 100
in 2719
five 5
minutes 2
At 272
present 20
however 1
I 4330
consider 13
myself 1
as 509
quite 1
fixed 2
here 31
That 11
is 124
exactly 1
what 14
I 4330
should 7
have 11
supposed 2
of 109
you 29
said 1
Elizabeth 5
You 29
begin 8
to 806
comprehend 4
me 1041
do 814
you 29
cried 1
he 962
turning 3
towards 1
her 181
Oh 17
understand 8
you 29
perfectly 1
I 4330
wish 13
I 4330
might 9
take 18
this 6
for 484
a 6799
compliment 6
but 82
to 806
be 1200
so 797
easily 1
seen 1
through 4
I 4330
am 392
afraid 1
is 124
pitiful 2
That 11
is 124
as 509
it 67
happens 4
It 67
does 5
not 85
follow 11
that 11
a 6799
deep 12
intricate 2
character 16
is 124
more 11
or 333
less 19
estimable 1
than 22
such 2
a 6799
one 19
as 509
yours 3
Lizzy 2
cried 1
her 181
mother 21
remember 4
where 21
you 29
are 12
and 51
do 814
not 85
run 50
on 86
in 2719
the 193
wild 36
manner 8
that 11
you 29
are 12
suffered 1
to 806
do 814
at 272
home 90
I 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
before 2
continued 1
immediately 1
that 11
you 29
were 5
a 6799
of 109
character 16
It 67
must 28
be 1200
an 970
amusing 2
study 3
Yes 16
but 82
intricate 2
characters 1
are 12
the 193
amusing 2
They 5
have 11
at 272
least 3
that 11
advantage 6
The 193
country 12
said 1
Darcy 2
can 287
in 2719
general 22
supply 3
but 82
a 6799
few 6
subjects 1
for 484
such 2
a 6799
study 3
In 2719
a 6799
country 12
you 29
move 10
in 2719
a 6799
very 1
confined 1
and 51
unvarying 1
society 2
But 82
people 4
themselves 1
alter 27
so 797
much 2
that 11
there 21
is 124
something 3
new 115
to 806
be 1200
observed 1
in 2719
them 9
for 484
ever 33
Yes 16
indeed 1
cried 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
offended 1
by 57
his 43
manner 8
of 109
mentioning 1
a 6799
country 12
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
there 21
is 124
quite 1
as 509
much 2
of 109
going 3
on 86
in 2719
the 193
country 12
as 509
in 2719
town 27
Everybody 2
was 93
surprised 1
and 51
Darcy 2
after 48
looking 1
at 272
her 181
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
turned 1
silently 1
away 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
who 79
fancied 1
she 199
had 11
gained 1
a 6799
complete 8
victory 2
over 596
him 9
continued 1
her 181
triumph 10
I 4330
cannot 1
see 70
that 11
London 5
has 41
any 17
great 12
advantage 6
over 596
the 193
country 12
for 484
my 90
part 102
except 10
the 193
shops 1
and 51
public 18
places 1
The 193
country 12
is 124
a 6799
vast 8
deal 13
pleasanter 1
is 124
it 67
not 85
Mr 5
When 6
I 4330
am 392
in 2719
the 193
country 12
he 962
replied 1
I 4330
never 3
wish 13
to 806
leave 14
it 67
and 51
when 6
I 4330
am 392
in 2719
town 27
it 67
is 124
pretty 3
much 2
the 193
same 5
They 5
have 11
each 1
their 2
advantages 1
and 51
I 4330
can 287
be 1200
equally 1
happy 1
in 2719
either 1
is 124
because 1
you 29
have 11
the 193
right 31
disposition 3
But 82
that 11
gentleman 3
looking 1
at 272
Darcy 2
seemed 1
to 806
think 8
the 193
country 12
was 93
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
Indeed 1
Mamma 9
you 29
are 12
mistaken 2
said 1
Elizabeth 5
blushing 1
for 484
her 181
mother 21
You 29
quite 1
mistook 1
Mr 5
Darcy 2
He 962
only 1
meant 3
that 11
there 21
was 93
not 85
such 2
a 6799
variety 2
of 109
people 4
to 806
be 1200
met 180
with 34
in 2719
the 193
country 12
as 509
in 2719
the 193
town 27
which 2
you 29
must 28
acknowledge 3
to 806
be 1200
true 9
Certainly 1
my 90
dear 15
nobody 2
said 1
there 21
were 5
but 82
as 509
to 806
not 85
meeting 6
with 34
many 2
people 4
in 2719
this 6
I 4330
believe 6
there 21
are 12
few 6
larger 1
I 4330
know 12
we 444
dine 9
with 34
families 1
Nothing 5
but 82
concern 6
for 484
Elizabeth 5
could 2
enable 6
to 806
keep 11
his 43
countenance 4
His 43
sister 9
was 93
less 19
delicate 7
and 51
directed 1
her 181
eyes 8
towards 1
Mr 5
Darcy 2
with 34
a 6799
very 1
expressive 4

Elizabeth 5
for 484
the 193
sake 2
of 109
saying 3
something 3
that 11
might 9
turn 46
her 181
mother's 1
thoughts 1
now 10
asked 1
her 181
if 8
Charlotte 4
Lucas 1
had 11
been 1
at 272
since 7
coming 3
away 1
Yes 16
she 199
called 1
yesterday 3
with 34
her 181
father 12
What 14
an 970
agreeable 3
man 343
Sir 22
William 3
is 124
Mr 5
is 124
not 85
he 962
So 797
much 2
the 193
man 343
of 109
fashion 10
So 797
genteel 4
and 51
easy 2
He 962
has 41
always 1
something 3
to 806
say 7
to 806
everybody 2
is 124
my 90
idea 21
of 109
good 29
breeding 2
and 51
those 1
persons 1
who 79
fancy 5
themselves 1
very 1
important 2
and 51
never 3
open 21
their 2
mouths 1
quite 1
mistake 5
the 193
matter 7
Did 23
Charlotte 4
dine 9
with 34
you 29
No 896
she 199
would 5
go 501
home 90
I 4330
fancy 5
she 199
was 93
wanted 1
about 1
the 193
For 484
my 90
part 102
Mr 5
always 1
keep 11
servants 1
that 11
can 287
do 814
their 2
own 9
work 87
daughters 1
are 12
brought 1
up 194
very 1
differently 1
But 82
everybody 2
is 124
to 806
judge 6
for 484
themselves 1
and 51
the 193
are 12
a 6799
very 1
good 29
sort 14
of 109
girls 1
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
It 67
is 124
a 6799
pity 4
they 5
are 12
not 85
handsome 6
Not 85
that 11
think 8
Charlotte 4
so 797
_very_ 1
then 5
she 199
is 124
our 3
particular 13
friend 14
She 199
seems 1
a 6799
very 1
pleasant 9
young 9
woman 21
Oh 17
dear 15
yes 16
but 82
you 29
must 28
own 9
she 199
is 124
very 1
plain 27
Lady 18
Lucas 1
herself 1
has 41
often 4
said 1
so 797
and 51
envied 1
me 1041
beauty 2
I 4330
do 814
not 85
like 22
to 806
boast 12
of 109
my 90
own 9
child 28
but 82
to 806
be 1200
sure 11
does 5
not 85
often 4
see 70
anybody 2
better 7
looking 1
It 67
is 124
what 14
everybody 2
says 1
I 4330
do 814
not 85
trust 26
my 90
own 9
partiality 2
When 6
she 199
was 93
only 1
fifteen 6
there 21
was 93
a 6799
man 343
at 272
my 90
brother 9
in 2719
town 27
so 797
much 2
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 181
that 11
my 90
was 93
sure 11
he 962
would 5
make 17
her 181
an 970
offer 10
before 2
we 444
came 36
away 1
But 82
however 1
he 962
did 23
not 85
Perhaps 1
he 962
thought 11
her 181
too 50
young 9
However 1
he 962
wrote 1
some 30
verses 1
on 86
her 181
and 51
very 1
pretty 3
they 5
were 5
And 51
so 797
ended 1
his 43
affection 5
said 1
Elizabeth 5
impatiently 1
There 21
has 41
been 1
many 2
a 6799
one 19
I 4330
fancy 5
overcome 2
in 2719
the 193
same 5
way 27
I 4330
wonder 17
who 79
first 8
discovered 1
the 193
efficacy 2
of 109
poetry 2
in 2719
driving 2
away 1
love 29
I 4330
have 11
been 1
used 1
to 806
consider 13
poetry 2
as 509
the 193
of 109
love 29
said 1
Darcy 2
Of 109
a 6799
fine 17
stout 9
healthy 1
love 29
it 67
may 49
Everything 2
nourishes 1
what 14
is 124
strong 16
already 1
But 82
if 8
it 67
be 1200
only 1
a 6799
slight 10
thin 35
sort 14
of 109
inclination 3
I 4330
am 392
convinced 1
that 11
one 19
good 29
sonnet 3
will 39
starve 6
it 67
entirely 1
away 1
Darcy 2
only 1
smiled 1
and 51
the 193
general 22
pause 4
which 2
ensued 1
made 13
Elizabeth 5
tremble 4
lest 5
her 181
mother 21
should 7
be 1200
exposing 1
herself 1
again 2
She 199
longed 1
to 806
speak 12
but 82
could 2
think 8
of 109
nothing 5
to 806
say 7
and 51
after 48
a 6799
short 62
silence 7
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
began 1
repeating 2
her 181
thanks 4
to 806
Mr 5
for 484
his 43
kindness 3
to 806
Jane 8
with 34
an 970
apology 2
for 484
troubling 1
him 9
also 3
with 34
Lizzy 2
Mr 5
was 93
unaffectedly 1
civil 15
in 2719
his 43
answer 8
and 51
forced 1
his 43
younger 1
sister 9
to 806
be 1200
civil 15
also 3
and 51
say 7
what 14
the 193
occasion 7
required 1
She 199
performed 1
her 181
part 102
indeed 1
without 1
much 2
graciousness 2
but 82
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
was 93
satisfied 1
and 51
soon 3
afterwards 1
ordered 1
her 181
carriage 5
Upon 1
this 6
signal 18
the 193
youngest 1
of 109
her 181
daughters 1
put 47
herself 1
forward 12
The 193
two 14
girls 1
had 11
been 1
whispering 1
to 806
each 1
other 5
during 1
the 193
whole 26
visit 14
and 51
the 193
result 8
of 109
it 67
was 93
that 11
the 193
youngest 1
should 7
tax 42
Mr 5
with 34
having 1
promised 1
on 86
his 43
first 8
coming 3
into 26
the 193
country 12
to 806
give 15
a 6799
ball 77
at 272
Lydia 4
was 93
a 6799
stout 9
girl 14
of 109
fifteen 6
with 34
a 6799
fine 17
complexion 5
and 51
good-humoured 1
countenance 4
a 6799
with 34
her 181
mother 21
whose 1
affection 5
had 11
brought 1
her 181
into 26
public 18
at 272
an 970
early 1
age 24
She 199
had 11
high 54
animal 6
spirits 1
and 51
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
natural 18
which 2
the 193
attention 3
of 109
the 193
officers 1
to 806
whom 3
her 181
uncle's 1
good 29
dinners 1
and 51
her 181
own 9
easy 2
manners 1
recommended 1
her 181
had 11
increased 1
into 26
assurance 3
She 199
was 93
very 1
equal 17
therefore 1
to 806
address 9
Mr 5
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 109
the 193
ball 77
and 51
abruptly 1
reminded 1
him 9
of 109
his 43
promise 4
adding 1
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
the 193
most 3
shameful 4
thing 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
if 8
he 962
did 23
not 85
keep 11
it 67
His 43
answer 8
to 806
this 6
sudden 4
attack 8
was 93
delightful 2
to 806
their 2
mother's 1
ear 114
I 4330
am 392
perfectly 1
ready 2
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
to 806
keep 11
my 90
engagement 3
and 51
when 6
your 4
sister 9
is 124
recovered 1
you 29
shall 12
if 8
you 29
please 3
name 17
the 193
very 1
day 27
of 109
the 193
ball 77
But 82
you 29
would 5
not 85
wish 13
to 806
be 1200
dancing 2
when 6
she 199
is 124
ill 84
Lydia 4
declared 1
herself 1
satisfied 1
Oh 17
would 5
be 1200
much 2
better 7
to 806
wait 19
till 14
Jane 8
was 93
well 24
and 51
by 57
that 11
time 45
most 3
likely 1
Captain 8
Carter 3
would 5
be 1200
at 272
again 2
And 51
when 6
you 29
have 11
given 3
ball 77
she 199
added 1
I 4330
shall 12
insist 9
on 86
their 2
giving 2
one 19
also 3
I 4330
shall 12
tell 16
Colonel 5
Forster 1
it 67
will 39
be 1200
quite 1
a 6799
shame 14
if 8
he 962
does 5
not 85
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
and 51
her 181
daughters 1
then 5
departed 2
and 51
Elizabeth 5
returned 1
instantly 1
to 806
Jane 8
leaving 3
her 181
own 9
and 51
her 181
to 806
the 193
remarks 1
of 109
the 193
two 14
ladies 1
and 51
Mr 5
Darcy 2
the 193
latter 3
of 109
whom 3
however 1
could 2
not 85
be 1200
prevailed 1
on 86
to 806
join 16
in 2719
their 2
censure 7
of 109
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
all 162
Miss 71
witticisms 1
on 86
Chapter 3
The 193
day 27
passed 1
much 2
as 509
the 193
day 27
before 2
had 11
done 3
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
and 51
Miss 71
had 11
spent 1
some 30
hours 1
of 109
the 193
morning 3
with 34
the 193
invalid 16
who 79
continued 1
though 12
slowly 1
to 806
mend 31
and 51
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
Elizabeth 5
joined 1
their 2
party 3
in 2719
the 193
The 193
however 1
did 23
not 85
appear 7
Mr 5
Darcy 2
was 93
writing 3
and 51
Miss 71
seated 1
near 15
him 9
was 93
watching 1
the 193
progress 14
of 109
his 43
letter 20
and 51
repeatedly 1
calling 3
off 100
his 43
attention 3
by 57
messages 1
to 806
his 43
sister 9
Mr 5
Hurst 2
and 51
Mr 5
were 5
at 272
and 51
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
was 93
observing 1
their 2
game 24
Elizabeth 5
took 1
up 194
some 30
needlework 2
and 51
was 93
sufficiently 1
amused 1
in 2719
attending 1
to 806
what 14
passed 1
between 1
Darcy 2
and 51
his 43
companion 10
The 193
perpetual 4
commendations 1
of 109
the 193
lady 18
either 1
on 86
his 43
handwriting 2
or 333
on 86
the 193
evenness 2
of 109
his 43
lines 4
or 333
on 86
the 193
length 14
of 109
his 43
letter 20
with 34
the 193
perfect 24
unconcern 4
with 34
which 2
her 181
praises 1
were 5
received 1
formed 1
a 6799
curious 4
dialogue 3
and 51
was 93
exactly 1
in 2719
union 14
with 34
her 181
opinion 4
of 109
each 1
How 27
delighted 2
Miss 71
Darcy 2
will 39
be 1200
to 806
receive 8
such 2
a 6799
letter 20
He 962
made 13
no 896
answer 8
You 29
write 5
uncommonly 1
fast 29
You 29
are 12
mistaken 2
I 4330
write 5
rather 2
slowly 1
How 27
many 2
letters 1
you 29
must 28
have 11
occasion 7
to 806
write 5
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
a 6799
year 19
Letters 1
of 109
business 13
too 50
How 27
odious 4
I 4330
should 7
think 8
them 9
It 67
is 124
fortunate 2
then 5
that 11
they 5
fall 29
to 806
my 90
lot 21
instead 1
of 109
yours 3
Pray 9
tell 16
your 4
sister 9
that 11
I 4330
long 49
to 806
see 70
her 181
I 4330
have 11
already 1
told 1
her 181
so 797
once 2
by 57
your 4
desire 6
I 4330
am 392
afraid 1
you 29
do 814
not 85
like 22
your 4
pen 195
Let 50
me 1041
mend 31
it 67
for 484
you 29
I 4330
mend 31
pens 16
remarkably 1
well 24
Thank 15
I 4330
always 1
mend 31
my 90
own 9
How 27
can 287
you 29
contrive 6
to 806
write 5
so 797
even 36
He 962
was 93
silent 6
Tell 16
your 4
sister 9
I 4330
am 392
delighted 2
to 806
hear 76
of 109
her 181
improvement 3
on 86
the 193
harp 27
and 51
pray 9
let 50
her 181
know 12
that 11
I 4330
am 392
quite 1
in 2719
raptures 1
with 34
her 181
beautiful 2
little 6
design 16
for 484
a 6799
table 27
and 51
I 4330
think 8
it 67
infinitely 1
superior 5
to 806
Miss 71
Will 39
you 29
give 15
me 1041
leave 14
to 806
defer 14
your 4
raptures 1
till 14
I 4330
write 5
again 2
At 272
present 20
I 4330
have 11
not 85
room 22
to 806
do 814
them 9
justice 3
Oh 17
it 67
is 124
of 109
no 896
consequence 3
I 4330
shall 12
see 70
her 181
in 2719
January 2
But 82
do 814
you 29
always 1
write 5
such 2
charming 2
long 49
letters 1
to 806
her 181
Mr 5
Darcy 2
They 5
are 12
generally 1
long 49
but 82
whether 1
always 1
charming 2
it 67
is 124
not 85
for 484
me 1041
to 806
determine 7
It 67
is 124
a 6799
rule 7
with 34
me 1041
that 11
a 6799
person 33
who 79
can 287
write 5
a 6799
long 49
letter 20
with 34
ease 10
cannot 1
write 5
ill 84
That 11
will 39
not 85
do 814
for 484
a 6799
compliment 6
to 806
Darcy 2
Caroline 1
cried 1
her 181
brother 9
because 1
he 962
does 5
write 5
with 34
ease 10
He 962
studies 1
too 50
much 2
for 484
words 5
of 109
four 26
syllables 1
Do 814
not 85
you 29
Darcy 2
My 90
style 4
of 109
writing 3
is 124
very 1
different 11
from 2
yours 3
Oh 17
cried 1
Miss 71
Charles 5
writes 1
in 2719
the 193
most 3
careless 4
way 27
imaginable 1
He 962
leaves 1
out 365
half 23
his 43
words 5
and 51
blots 1
the 193
rest 110
My 90
ideas 1
flow 27
so 797
rapidly 1
that 11
I 4330
have 11
not 85
time 45
to 806
express 25
which 2
means 1
my 90
letters 1
sometimes 1
convey 12
no 896
ideas 1
at 272
all 162
to 806
my 90
correspondents 1
Your 4
humility 2
Mr 5
said 1
Elizabeth 5
must 28
disarm 7
reproof 5
Nothing 5
is 124
more 11
deceitful 4
said 1
Darcy 2
than 22
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
humility 2
It 67
is 124
often 4
only 1
carelessness 2
of 109
opinion 4
and 51
sometimes 1
an 970
indirect 6
boast 12
And 51
which 2
of 109
the 193
two 14
do 814
you 29
call 57
little 6
recent 6
piece 10
of 109
modesty 2
The 193
indirect 6
boast 12
for 484
you 29
are 12
really 1
proud 5
of 109
your 4
defects 1
in 2719
writing 3
because 1
you 29
consider 13
them 9
as 509
proceeding 3
from 2
a 6799
rapidity 2
of 109
thought 11
and 51
carelessness 2
of 109
execution 6
which 2
if 8
not 85
estimable 1
you 29
think 8
at 272
least 3
highly 1
interesting 2
The 193
power 19
of 109
doing 3
anything 3
with 34
quickness 2
is 124
always 1
prized 1
much 2
by 57
the 193
possessor 3
and 51
often 4
without 1
any 17
attention 3
to 806
the 193
imperfection 3
of 109
the 193
performance 3
When 6
you 29
told 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
this 6
morning 3
that 11
if 8
you 29
ever 33
resolved 1
upon 1
quitting 1
you 29
should 7
be 1200
gone 4
in 2719
five 5
minutes 2
you 29
meant 3
it 67
to 806
be 1200
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
panegyric 3
of 109
compliment 6
to 806
yet 4
what 14
is 124
there 21
so 797
very 1
laudable 1
in 2719
a 6799
which 2
must 28
leave 14
very 1
necessary 2
business 13
undone 1
and 51
can 287
be 1200
of 109
no 896
real 47
advantage 6
to 806
yourself 1
or 333
anyone 2
else 2
Nay 6
cried 1
this 6
is 124
too 50
much 2
to 806
remember 4
at 272
night 61
all 162
the 193
foolish 4
things 1
that 11
were 5
said 1
in 2719
the 193
morning 3
And 51
yet 4
upon 1
my 90
I 4330
believe 6
what 14
I 4330
said 1
of 109
myself 1
to 806
be 1200
true 9
and 51
I 4330
believe 6
it 67
at 272
this 6
moment 14
At 272
least 3
therefore 1
I 4330
did 23
not 85
assume 3
the 193
character 16
of 109
needless 4
merely 1
to 806
show 64
off 100
before 2
the 193
ladies 1
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
you 29
believed 1
it 67
but 82
I 4330
am 392
by 57
no 896
means 1
convinced 1
that 11
you 29
would 5
be 1200
gone 4
with 34
such 2
celerity 2
Your 4
conduct 21
would 5
be 1200
quite 1
as 509
dependent 4
on 86
chance 20
as 509
that 11
of 109
any 17
man 343
I 4330
know 12
and 51
if 8
as 509
you 29
were 5
mounting 3
your 4
horse 52
a 6799
friend 14
were 5
to 806
say 7
you 29
had 11
better 7
stay 7
till 14
next 2
week 20
you 29
would 5
probably 1
do 814
it 67
you 29
would 5
probably 1
not 85
at 272
another 1
word 26
might 9
stay 7
a 6799
month 6
You 29
have 11
only 1
proved 1
by 57
this 6
cried 1
Elizabeth 5
that 11
Mr 5
did 23
not 85
do 814
justice 3
to 806
his 43
own 9
disposition 3
You 29
have 11
shown 1
him 9
off 100
now 10
much 2
more 11
than 22
he 962
did 23
himself 1
I 4330
am 392
exceedingly 1
gratified 1
said 1
by 57
your 4
converting 1
what 14
my 90
friend 14
says 1
into 26
a 6799
compliment 6
on 86
the 193
sweetness 2
of 109
my 90
temper 22
But 82
I 4330
am 392
afraid 1
you 29
are 12
giving 2
it 67
a 6799
turn 46
which 2
that 11
gentleman 3
did 23
by 57
no 896
means 1
intend 6
for 484
he 962
would 5
certainly 1
think 8
better 7
of 109
me 1041
if 8
under 288
such 2
a 6799
circumstance 4
I 4330
were 5
to 806
give 15
a 6799
flat 66
denial 3
and 51
ride 9
off 100
as 509
fast 29
as 509
I 4330
could 2
Would 5
Mr 5
Darcy 2
then 5
consider 13
the 193
rashness 2
of 109
your 4
original 6
intentions 1
as 509
atoned 1
for 484
by 57
your 4
obstinacy 2
in 2719
adhering 1
to 806
it 67
Upon 1
my 90
word 26
I 4330
cannot 1
exactly 1
explain 5
the 193
matter 7
Darcy 2
must 28
speak 12
for 484
himself 1
You 29
expect 20
me 1041
to 806
account 14
for 484
opinions 1
which 2
you 29
choose 5
to 806
call 57
mine 26
but 82
which 2
I 4330
have 11
never 3
acknowledged 1
Allowing 1
the 193
case 25
however 1
to 806
stand 42
according 2
to 806
your 4
representation 4
you 29
must 28
remember 4
Miss 71
Bennet 1
that 11
the 193
friend 14
who 79
is 124
supposed 2
to 806
desire 6
his 43
return 14
to 806
the 193
house 87
and 51
the 193
delay 8
of 109
his 43
plan 61
has 41
merely 1
desired 1
it 67
asked 1
it 67
without 1
offering 3
one 19
argument 9
in 2719
of 109
its 2
propriety 2
To 806
yield 6
the 193
of 109
a 6799
friend 14
is 124
no 896
merit 13
with 34
you 29
To 806
yield 6
without 1
conviction 3
is 124
no 896
compliment 6
to 806
the 193
understanding 4
of 109
either 1
You 29
appear 7
to 806
me 1041
Mr 5
Darcy 2
to 806
allow 9
nothing 5
for 484
the 193
influence 4
of 109
friendship 3
and 51
affection 5
A 6799
regard 7
for 484
the 193
requester 1
would 5
often 4
make 17
one 19
readily 1
yield 6
to 806
a 6799
request 6
without 1
waiting 2
for 484
arguments 1
to 806
reason 13
one 19
into 26
it 67
I 4330
am 392
not 85
particularly 1
speaking 2
of 109
such 2
a 6799
case 25
as 509
you 29
have 11
supposed 2
about 1
Mr 5
We 444
may 49
as 509
well 24
wait 19
perhaps 1
till 14
the 193
circumstance 4
occurs 1
before 2
we 444
discuss 10
the 193
discretion 3
of 109
his 43
thereupon 1
But 82
in 2719
general 22
and 51
ordinary 2
cases 1
between 1
friend 14
and 51
friend 14
where 21
one 19
of 109
them 9
is 124
desired 1
by 57
the 193
other 5
to 806
change 21
a 6799
resolution 3
of 109
no 896
very 1
great 12
moment 14
should 7
you 29
think 8
ill 84
of 109
that 11
person 33
for 484
complying 1
with 34
the 193
desire 6
without 1
waiting 2
to 806
be 1200
argued 1
into 26
it 67
Will 39
it 67
not 85
be 1200
advisable 1
before 2
we 444
proceed 7
on 86
this 6
subject 11
to 806
arrange 9
with 34
rather 2
more 11
precision 2
the 193
degree 3
of 109
importance 2
which 2
is 124
to 806
appertain 4
to 806
this 6
request 6
as 509
well 24
as 509
the 193
degree 3
of 109
intimacy 2
subsisting 1
between 1
the 193
parties 1
By 57
all 162
means 1
cried 1
let 50
us 70
hear 76
all 162
the 193
particulars 1
not 85
forgetting 1
their 2
comparative 4
height 7
and 51
size 5
for 484
that 11
will 39
have 11
more 11
weight 21
in 2719
the 193
argument 9
Miss 71
Bennet 1
than 22
you 29
may 49
be 1200
aware 3
of 109
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
that 11
if 8
Darcy 2
were 5
not 85
such 2
a 6799
great 12
tall 35
fellow 9
in 2719
comparison 3
with 34
myself 1
I 4330
should 7
not 85
pay 52
him 9
half 23
so 797
much 2
deference 2
I 4330
declare 6
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
a 6799
more 11
awful 6
object 26
than 22
Darcy 2
on 86
particular 13
occasions 1
and 51
in 2719
particular 13
places 1
at 272
his 43
own 9
house 87
especially 1
and 51
of 109
a 6799
Sunday 3
evening 3
when 6
he 962
has 41
nothing 5
to 806
do 814
Mr 5
Darcy 2
smiled 1
but 82
Elizabeth 5
thought 11
she 199
could 2
perceive 3
that 11
he 962
was 93
rather 2
offended 1
and 51
therefore 1
checked 1
her 181
laugh 14
Miss 71
warmly 1
resented 1
the 193
indignity 2
he 962
had 11
received 1
in 2719
an 970
expostulation 3
with 34
her 181
brother 9
for 484
talking 1
such 2
nonsense 2
I 4330
see 70
your 4
design 16
said 1
his 43
friend 14
You 29
dislike 4
an 970
argument 9
and 51
want 13
to 806
silence 7
this 6
Perhaps 1
I 4330
do 814
Arguments 1
are 12
too 50
much 2
like 22
disputes 1
If 8
you 29
and 51
Miss 71
Bennet 1
will 39
defer 14
yours 3
till 14
I 4330
am 392
out 365
of 109
the 193
room 22
I 4330
shall 12
be 1200
very 1
thankful 4
and 51
then 5
you 29
may 49
say 7
whatever 1
you 29
like 22
of 109
me 1041
What 14
you 29
ask 6
said 1
Elizabeth 5
is 124
no 896
sacrifice 4
on 86
my 90
side 74
and 51
Mr 5
Darcy 2
had 11
much 2
better 7
finish 8
his 43
letter 20
Mr 5
Darcy 2
took 1
her 181
advice 2
and 51
did 23
finish 8
his 43
letter 20
When 6
that 11
business 13
was 93
over 596
he 962
applied 1
to 806
Miss 71
and 51
Elizabeth 5
for 484
an 970
indulgence 3
of 109
some 30
music 24
Miss 71
moved 1
with 34
some 30
alacrity 2
to 806
the 193
pianoforte 3
and 51
after 48
a 6799
polite 8
request 6
that 11
Elizabeth 5
would 5
lead 15
the 193
way 27
which 2
the 193
other 5
as 509
politely 1
and 51
more 11
earnestly 1
negatived 1
she 199
seated 1
herself 1
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
sang 11
with 34
her 181
sister 9
and 51
while 4
they 5
were 5
thus 1
employed 1
Elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
help 23
observing 1
as 509
she 199
turned 1
over 596
some 30
that 11
lay 42
on 86
the 193
instrument 16
how 27
frequently 1
Mr 5
Darcy's 1
eyes 8
were 5
fixed 2
on 86
her 181
She 199
hardly 1
knew 1
how 27
to 806
suppose 4
that 11
she 199
could 2
be 1200
an 970
object 26
of 109
admiration 2
to 806
so 797
great 12
a 6799
man 343
and 51
yet 4
that 11
he 962
should 7
look 14
at 272
her 181
because 1
he 962
disliked 1
her 181
was 93
still 13
more 11
strange 8
She 199
could 2
only 1
imagine 3
however 1
at 272
last 7
that 11
she 199
drew 2
his 43
notice 8
because 1
there 21
was 93
something 3
more 11
wrong 24
and 51
reprehensible 1
according 2
to 806
his 43
ideas 1
of 109
right 31
than 22
in 2719
any 17
other 5
person 33
present 20
The 193
supposition 3
did 23
not 85
pain 42
her 181
She 199
liked 1
him 9
too 50
little 6
to 806
care 47
for 484
his 43
approbation 3
After 48
playing 1
some 30
Italian 4
songs 7
Miss 71
varied 1
the 193
charm 14
by 57
a 6799
lively 1
Scotch 12
air 129
and 51
soon 3
afterwards 1
Mr 5
Darcy 2
drawing 3
near 15
Elizabeth 5
said 1
to 806
her 181
Do 814
not 85
you 29
feel 11
a 6799
great 12
inclination 3
Miss 71
Bennet 1
to 806
seize 3
such 2
an 970
opportunity 2
of 109
dancing 2
a 6799
reel 12
She 199
smiled 1
but 82
made 13
no 896
answer 8
He 962
repeated 2
the 193
question 16
with 34
some 30
surprise 4
at 272
her 181
silence 7
Oh 17
said 1
she 199
I 4330
heard 1
you 29
before 2
but 82
I 4330
could 2
not 85
immediately 1
determine 7
what 14
to 806
say 7
in 2719
reply 3
You 29
wanted 1
me 1041
I 4330
know 12
to 806
say 7
that 11
you 29
might 9
have 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
despising 1
my 90
taste 15
but 82
I 4330
always 1
delight 8
in 2719
overthrowing 1
those 1
kind 31
of 109
schemes 1
and 51
cheating 1
a 6799
person 33
of 109
their 2
premeditated 1
contempt 8
I 4330
have 11
therefore 1
made 13
up 194
my 90
mind 25
to 806
tell 16
you 29
that 11
I 4330
do 814
not 85
want 13
to 806
dance 7
a 6799
reel 12
at 272
now 10
despise 3
me 1041
if 8
you 29
dare 15
Indeed 1
I 4330
do 814
not 85
dare 15
Elizabeth 5
having 1
rather 2
expected 1
to 806
affront 5
him 9
was 93
amazed 1
at 272
his 43
gallantry 2
but 82
there 21
was 93
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
sweetness 2
and 51
archness 2
in 2719
her 181
manner 8
which 2
made 13
it 67
difficult 5
for 484
her 181
to 806
affront 5
anybody 2
and 51
Darcy 2
had 11
never 3
been 1
so 797
bewitched 1
by 57
any 17
woman 21
as 509
he 962
was 93
by 57
her 181
He 962
really 1
believed 1
that 11
were 5
it 67
not 85
for 484
the 193
inferiority 2
of 109
her 181
connections 1
he 962
should 7
be 1200
in 2719
some 30
danger 7
Miss 71
saw 24
or 333
suspected 1
enough 2
to 806
be 1200
jealous 5
and 51
her 181
great 12
anxiety 2
for 484
the 193
recovery 2
of 109
her 181
dear 15
friend 14
Jane 8
received 1
some 30
assistance 2
from 2
her 181
desire 6
of 109
getting 1
rid 42
of 109
Elizabeth 5
She 199
often 4
tried 1
to 806
provoke 6
Darcy 2
into 26
disliking 1
her 181
guest 9
by 57
talking 1
of 109
their 2
supposed 2
marriage 6
and 51
planning 2
his 43
happiness 2
in 2719
such 2
an 970
alliance 3
I 4330
hope 16
said 1
she 199
as 509
they 5
were 5
walking 2
together 3
in 2719
the 193
shrubbery 2
the 193
next 2
day 27
you 29
will 39
give 15
your 4
a 6799
few 6
hints 1
when 6
this 6
desirable 3
event 18
takes 1
place 29
as 509
to 806
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
holding 3
her 181
tongue 5
and 51
if 8
you 29
can 287
compass 9
it 67
do 814
cure 9
the 193
younger 1
girls 1
of 109
running 2
after 48
officers 1
And 51
if 8
I 4330
may 49
mention 5
so 797
delicate 7
a 6799
subject 11
to 806
check 40
that 11
little 6
something 3
bordering 1
on 86
conceit 7
and 51
impertinence 3
which 2
your 4
lady 18
possesses 1
Have 11
you 29
anything 3
else 2
to 806
propose 6
for 484
my 90
domestic 12
felicity 2
Oh 17
yes 16
Do 814
let 50
the 193
portraits 1
of 109
your 4
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
Phillips 1
be 1200
placed 1
in 2719
the 193
gallery 2
at 272
Put 47
them 9
next 2
to 806
your 4
the 193
judge 6
They 5
are 12
in 2719
the 193
same 5
profession 14
you 29
know 12
only 1
in 2719
different 11
lines 4
As 509
for 484
your 4
Elizabeth's 1
picture 8
you 29
must 28
not 85
have 11
it 67
taken 1
for 484
what 14
painter 4
could 2
do 814
justice 3
to 806
those 1
beautiful 2
eyes 8
It 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
easy 2
indeed 1
to 806
catch 24
their 2
expression 11
but 82
their 2
and 51
shape 13
and 51
the 193
eyelashes 1
so 797
remarkably 1
fine 17
might 9
be 1200
copied 1
At 272
that 11
moment 14
they 5
were 5
met 180
from 2
another 1
walk 25
by 57
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
and 51
Elizabeth 5
herself 1
I 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 29
intended 3
to 806
walk 25
said 1
Miss 71
in 2719
some 30
confusion 3
lest 5
they 5
had 11
been 1
overheard 1
You 29
used 1
us 70
abominably 1
ill 84
answered 1
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
running 2
away 1
without 1
telling 2
us 70
that 11
you 29
were 5
coming 3
out 365
Then 5
taking 4
the 193
disengaged 1
arm 82
of 109
Mr 5
Darcy 2
she 199
left 19
Elizabeth 5
to 806
walk 25
by 57
herself 1
The 193
path 25
just 24
admitted 2
three 12
Mr 5
Darcy 2
felt 5
their 2
rudeness 2
and 51
immediately 1
said 1
This 6
walk 25
is 124
not 85
wide 15
enough 2
for 484
our 3
party 3
We 444
had 11
better 7
go 501
into 26
the 193
avenue 3
But 82
Elizabeth 5
who 79
had 11
not 85
the 193
least 3
inclination 3
to 806
remain 9
with 34
them 9
laughingly 1
answered 1
No 896
no 896
stay 7
where 21
you 29
are 12
You 29
are 12
charmingly 1
grouped 1
and 51
appear 7
to 806
uncommon 6
advantage 6
The 193
picturesque 4
would 5
be 1200
by 57
admitting 1
a 6799
fourth 4
She 199
then 5
ran 110
gaily 1
off 100
rejoicing 3
as 509
she 199
rambled 1
about 1
in 2719
the 193
hope 16
of 109
being 3
at 272
home 90
again 2
in 2719
a 6799
day 27
or 333
two 14
Jane 8
was 93
already 1
so 797
much 2
recovered 1
as 509
to 806
intend 6
leaving 3
her 181
room 22
for 484
a 6799
couple 7
of 109
hours 1
that 11
evening 3
Chapter 3
When 6
the 193
ladies 1
removed 1
after 48
dinner 9
Elizabeth 5
ran 110
up 194
to 806
her 181
sister 9
and 51
seeing 2
her 181
well 24
guarded 2
from 2
cold 9
attended 1
her 181
into 26
the 193
where 21
she 199
was 93
welcomed 1
by 57
her 181
two 14
friends 4
with 34
many 2
professions 1
of 109
pleasure 5
and 51
Elizabeth 5
had 11
never 3
seen 1
them 9
so 797
agreeable 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
during 1
the 193
hour 10
which 2
passed 1
before 2
the 193
gentlemen 1
appeared 1
Their 2
powers 1
of 109
conversation 8
were 5
considerable 1
They 5
could 2
describe 6
an 970
entertainment 3
with 34
accuracy 2
relate 8
an 970
anecdote 3
with 34
and 51
laugh 14
at 272
their 2
acquaintance 5
with 34
spirit 20
But 82
when 6
the 193
gentlemen 1
entered 1
Jane 8
was 93
no 896
longer 1
the 193
first 8
object 26
Miss 71
eyes 8
were 5
instantly 1
turned 1
toward 2
Darcy 2
and 51
she 199
had 11
something 3
to 806
say 7
to 806
him 9
before 2
he 962
had 11
advanced 1
many 2
steps 7
He 962
addressed 1
himself 1
to 806
Miss 71
Bennet 1
with 34
a 6799
polite 8
congratulation 3
Mr 5
Hurst 2
also 3
made 13
her 181
a 6799
slight 10
bow 58
and 51
said 1
he 962
was 93
very 1
glad 30
but 82
diffuseness 2
and 51
warmth 2
remained 1
for 484
salutation 3
He 962
was 93
full 16
of 109
joy 36
and 51
attention 3
The 193
first 8
was 93
spent 1
in 2719
piling 3
up 194
the 193
fire 103
lest 5
she 199
should 7
suffer 11
from 2
the 193
change 21
of 109
room 22
and 51
she 199
removed 1
at 272
his 43
desire 6
to 806
the 193
other 5
side 74
of 109
the 193
fireplace 3
that 11
she 199
might 9
be 1200
further 8
from 2
the 193
door 41
He 962
then 5
sat 92
down 90
by 57
her 181
and 51
talked 1
scarcely 1
to 806
anyone 2
else 2
Elizabeth 5
at 272
work 87
in 2719
the 193
opposite 4
corner 8
saw 24
it 67
all 162
with 34
great 12
delight 8
When 6
tea 99
was 93
over 596
Mr 5
Hurst 2
reminded 1
his 43
of 109
the 193
in 2719
vain 8
She 199
had 11
obtained 1
private 9
intelligence 2
that 11
Mr 5
Darcy 2
did 23
not 85
wish 13
for 484
cards 7
and 51
Mr 5
Hurst 2
soon 3
found 18
even 36
his 43
open 21
petition 8
rejected 1
She 199
assured 4
him 9
that 11
no 896
one 19
intended 3
to 806
play 73
and 51
the 193
silence 7
of 109
the 193
whole 26
party 3
on 86
the 193
subject 11
seemed 1
to 806
justify 2
her 181
Mr 5
Hurst 2
had 11
therefore 1
nothing 5
to 806
do 814
but 82
to 806
stretch 15
himself 1
on 86
one 19
of 109
the 193
sofas 1
and 51
go 501
to 806
sleep 33
Darcy 2
took 1
up 194
a 6799
book 69
Miss 71
did 23
the 193
same 5
and 51
Mrs 1
Hurst 2
principally 1
occupied 1
in 2719
playing 1
with 34
her 181
bracelets 1
and 51
rings 3
joined 1
now 10
and 51
then 5
in 2719
her 181
brother's 1
conversation 8
with 34
Miss 71
Bennet 1
Miss 71
attention 3
was 93
quite 1
as 509
much 2
engaged 1
in 2719
watching 1
Mr 5
Darcy's 1
progress 14
through 4
book 69
as 509
in 2719
reading 3
her 181
own 9
and 51
she 199
was 93
perpetually 1
either 1
making 4
some 30
inquiry 2
or 333
looking 1
at 272
his 43
page 15
She 199
could 2
not 85
win 229
him 9
however 1
to 806
any 17
conversation 8
he 962
merely 1
answered 1
her 181
question 16
and 51
read 49
on 86
At 272
length 14
quite 1
exhausted 1
by 57
the 193
attempt 5
to 806
be 1200
amused 1
with 34
her 181
own 9
book 69
which 2
she 199
had 11
only 1
chosen 1
because 1
it 67
was 93
the 193
second 16
volume 3
of 109
his 43
she 199
gave 4
a 6799
great 12
yawn 8
and 51
said 1
How 27
pleasant 9
it 67
is 124
to 806
spend 11
an 970
evening 3
in 2719
this 6
way 27
I 4330
declare 6
after 48
all 162
there 21
is 124
no 896
enjoyment 3
like 22
reading 3
How 27
much 2
sooner 1
one 19
tires 7
of 109
anything 3
than 22
of 109
a 6799
book 69
When 6
I 4330
have 11
a 6799
house 87
of 109
my 90
own 9
I 4330
shall 12
be 1200
miserable 3
if 8
I 4330
have 11
not 85
an 970
excellent 2
library 2
No 896
one 19
made 13
any 17
reply 3
She 199
then 5
yawned 1
again 2
threw 1
aside 3
her 181
book 69
and 51
cast 54
her 181
eyes 8
round 29
the 193
room 22
in 2719
quest 21
for 484
some 30
amusement 3
when 6
hearing 3
her 181
brother 9
mentioning 1
a 6799
ball 77
to 806
Miss 71
Bennet 1
she 199
turned 1
suddenly 1
towards 1
him 9
and 51
said 1
By 57
the 193
bye 5
Charles 5
are 12
you 29
really 1
serious 4
in 2719
meditating 1
a 6799
dance 7
at 272
I 4330
would 5
advise 9
you 29
before 2
you 29
determine 7
on 86
it 67
to 806
consult 14
the 193
wishes 1
of 109
the 193
present 20
party 3
I 4330
am 392
much 2
mistaken 2
if 8
there 21
are 12
not 85
some 30
among 1
us 70
to 806
whom 3
a 6799
ball 77
would 5
be 1200
rather 2
a 6799
punishment 3
than 22
a 6799
pleasure 5
If 8
you 29
mean 36
Darcy 2
cried 1
her 181
brother 9
he 962
may 49
go 501
to 806
bed 93
if 8
he 962
chooses 1
before 2
it 67
as 509
for 484
the 193
ball 77
it 67
is 124
quite 1
a 6799
settled 1
thing 15
and 51
as 509
soon 3
as 509
has 41
made 13
white 55
soup 13
enough 2
I 4330
shall 12
send 10
round 29
my 90
cards 7
I 4330
should 7
like 22
balls 7
infinitely 1
better 7
she 199
replied 1
if 8
they 5
were 5
carried 1
on 86
in 2719
a 6799
different 11
manner 8
but 82
there 21
is 124
something 3
insufferably 1
tedious 4
in 2719
the 193
usual 3
process 16
of 109
such 2
a 6799
meeting 6
It 67
would 5
surely 1
be 1200
much 2
more 11
rational 22
if 8
conversation 8
instead 1
of 109
dancing 2
were 5
made 13
the 193
order 11
of 109
the 193
day 27
Much 2
more 11
rational 22
my 90
dear 15
Caroline 1
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
but 82
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
near 15
so 797
much 2
like 22
a 6799
ball 77
Miss 71
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
soon 3
afterwards 1
she 199
got 14
up 194
and 51
walked 1
about 1
the 193
room 22
Her 181
figure 7
was 93
elegant 2
and 51
she 199
walked 1
well 24
but 82
Darcy 2
at 272
whom 3
it 67
was 93
all 162
aimed 1
was 93
still 13
inflexibly 1
studious 4
In 2719
the 193
desperation 2
of 109
her 181
feelings 1
she 199
resolved 1
on 86
one 19
effort 7
more 11
and 51
turning 3
to 806
Elizabeth 5
said 1
Miss 71
Eliza 7
Bennet 1
let 50
me 1041
persuade 6
you 29
to 806
follow 11
my 90
example 4
and 51
take 18
a 6799
turn 46
about 1
the 193
room 22
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
it 67
is 124
very 1
refreshing 2
after 48
sitting 3
so 797
long 49
in 2719
one 19
attitude 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
surprised 1
but 82
agreed 1
to 806
it 67
immediately 1
Miss 71
succeeded 1
no 896
less 19
in 2719
the 193
real 47
object 26
of 109
her 181
civility 2
Mr 5
Darcy 2
looked 1
up 194
He 962
was 93
as 509
much 2
awake 8
to 806
the 193
novelty 2
of 109
attention 3
in 2719
that 11
quarter 25
as 509
Elizabeth 5
herself 1
could 2
be 1200
and 51
unconsciously 1
closed 1
his 43
book 69
He 962
was 93
directly 1
invited 1
to 806
join 16
their 2
party 3
but 82
he 962
declined 1
it 67
observing 1
that 11
he 962
could 2
imagine 3
but 82
two 14
motives 1
for 484
their 2
choosing 1
to 806
walk 25
up 194
and 51
down 90
the 193
room 22
together 3
with 34
either 1
of 109
which 2
motives 1
his 43
joining 1
them 9
would 5
interfere 5
What 14
could 2
he 962
mean 36
She 199
was 93
dying 2
to 806
know 12
what 14
could 2
be 1200
his 43
meaning 11
asked 1
Elizabeth 5
whether 1
she 199
could 2
at 272
all 162
understand 8
him 9
Not 85
at 272
all 162
was 93
her 181
answer 8
but 82
depend 17
upon 1
it 67
he 962
means 1
to 806
be 1200
severe 7
on 86
us 70
and 51
our 3
surest 1
way 27
of 109
disappointing 2
him 9
will 39
be 1200
to 806
ask 6
nothing 5
about 1
it 67
Miss 71
however 1
was 93
incapable 1
of 109
disappointing 2
Mr 5
Darcy 2
in 2719
anything 3
and 51
persevered 1
therefore 1
in 2719
requiring 1
an 970
explanation 3
of 109
his 43
two 14
motives 1
I 4330
have 11
not 85
the 193
smallest 1
objection 5
to 806
explaining 1
them 9
said 1
he 962
as 509
soon 3
as 509
she 199
allowed 1
him 9
to 806
speak 12
You 29
either 1
choose 5
this 6
method 18
of 109
passing 3
the 193
evening 3
because 1
you 29
are 12
in 2719
each 1
confidence 3
and 51
have 11
secret 25
affairs 1
to 806
discuss 10
or 333
because 1
you 29
are 12
conscious 5
that 11
your 4
figures 1
appear 7
to 806
the 193
greatest 1
advantage 6
in 2719
walking 2
if 8
the 193
first 8
I 4330
would 5
be 1200
completely 1
in 2719
your 4
way 27
and 51
if 8
the 193
second 16
I 4330
can 287
admire 6
you 29
much 2
better 7
as 509
I 4330
sit 29
by 57
the 193
fire 103
Oh 17
shocking 2
cried 1
Miss 71
I 4330
never 3
heard 1
anything 3
so 797
abominable 1
How 27
shall 12
we 444
punish 9
him 9
for 484
such 2
a 6799
speech 13
Nothing 5
so 797
easy 2
if 8
you 29
have 11
but 82
the 193
inclination 3
said 1
Elizabeth 5
We 444
can 287
all 162
plague 4
and 51
punish 9
one 19
another 1
Tease 10
at 272
him 9
Intimate 5
as 509
you 29
are 12
you 29
must 28
know 12
how 27
it 67
is 124
to 806
be 1200
done 3
But 82
upon 1
my 90
I 4330
do 814
I 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29
that 11
my 90
intimacy 2
has 41
not 85
yet 4
taught 1
me 1041
Tease 10
calmness 2
of 109
manner 8
and 51
presence 3
of 109
mind 25
No 896
no 896
I 4330
feel 11
he 962
may 49
defy 2
us 70
there 21
And 51
as 509
to 806
laughter 2
we 444
will 39
not 85
expose 4
ourselves 1
if 8
you 29
please 3
by 57
attempting 1
to 806
laugh 14
without 1
a 6799
subject 11
Mr 5
Darcy 2
may 49
hug 20
himself 1
Mr 5
Darcy 2
is 124
not 85
to 806
be 1200
laughed 1
at 272
cried 1
Elizabeth 5
That 11
is 124
an 970
uncommon 6
advantage 6
and 51
uncommon 6
I 4330
hope 16
it 67
will 39
continue 3
for 484
it 67
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
great 12
loss 3
to 806
to 806
have 11
many 2
such 2
acquaintances 3
I 4330
dearly 1
love 29
a 6799
laugh 14
Miss 71
said 1
he 962
has 41
given 3
me 1041
more 11
credit 12
than 22
can 287
be 1200
The 193
wisest 1
and 51
the 193
best 37
of 109
the 193
wisest 1
and 51
best 37
of 109
their 2
be 1200
rendered 1
ridiculous 4
by 57
a 6799
person 33
whose 1
first 8
object 26
in 2719
life 44
is 124
a 6799
joke 8
Certainly 1

there 21
are 12
such 2
people 4
but 82
I 4330
hope 16
I 4330
am 392
not 85
one 19
of 109
I 4330
hope 16
I 4330
never 3
ridicule 4
what 14
is 124
wise 17
and 51
good 29
Follies 1
and 51
nonsense 2
whims 8
and 51
inconsistencies 1
divert 6
me 1041
I 4330
own 9
and 51
I 4330
laugh 14
at 272
them 9
whenever 1
I 4330
can 287
But 82
these 4
I 4330
suppose 4
are 12
precisely 1
what 14
you 29
are 12
without 1
Perhaps 1
that 11
is 124
not 85
possible 3
for 484
anyone 2
But 82
it 67
has 41
been 1
the 193
study 3
of 109
my 90
life 44
to 806
avoid 8
those 1
weaknesses 1
which 2
often 4
expose 4
a 6799
strong 16
understanding 4
to 806
ridicule 4
Such 2
as 509
vanity 2
and 51
pride 6
Yes 16
vanity 2
is 124
a 6799
weakness 3
indeed 1
But 82
there 21
is 124
a 6799
real 47
superiority 2
of 109
mind 25
pride 6
will 39
be 1200
always 1
under 288
good 29
regulation 3

Your 4
examination 3
of 109
Mr 5
Darcy 2
is 124
over 596
I 4330
presume 3
said 1
Miss 71
and 51
pray 9
what 14
is 124
the 193
result 8
I 4330
am 392
perfectly 1
convinced 1
by 57
it 67
that 11
Mr 5
Darcy 2
has 41
no 896
defect 17
He 962
owns 1
it 67
himself 1
without 1
disguise 4
No 896
said 1
Darcy 2
I 4330
have 11
made 13
no 896
such 2
pretension 3
I 4330
have 11
faults 1
enough 2
but 82
they 5
are 12
not 85
I 4330
hope 16
of 109
understanding 4
My 90
temper 22
I 4330
dare 15
not 85
vouch 11
for 484
It 67
is 124
I 4330
believe 6
too 50
little 6
too 50
little 6
for 484
the 193
convenience 3
of 109
the 193
world 12
I 4330
cannot 1
forget 8
the 193
follies 1
and 51
vices 1
of 109
others 1
so 797
soon 3
as 509
I 4330
ought 2
nor 102
their 2
offenses 1
against 1
myself 1
My 90
feelings 1
are 12
not 85
puffed 1
about 1
with 34
every 10
attempt 5
to 806
move 10
them 9
My 90
temper 22
would 5
perhaps 1
be 1200
called 1
resentful 4
My 90
good 29
opinion 4
once 2
lost 1
is 124
lost 1
forever 3
is 124
a 6799
failing 3
indeed 1
cried 1
Elizabeth 5
Implacable 1
resentment 3
a 6799
shade 4
in 2719
a 6799
character 16
But 82
you 29
have 11
chosen 1
your 4
fault 20
well 24
I 4330
really 1
cannot 1
at 272
it 67
You 29
are 12
safe 20
from 2
me 1041
There 21
is 124
I 4330
believe 6
in 2719
every 10
disposition 3
a 6799
tendency 2
to 806
some 30
particular 13
natural 18
defect 17
which 2
not 85
even 36
the 193
best 37
education 9
can 287
overcome 2
And 51
defect 17
is 124
to 806
hate 14
everybody 2
And 51
yours 3
he 962
replied 1
with 34
a 6799
smile 7
is 124
willfully 1
to 806
misunderstand 5
them 9
Do 814
let 50
us 70
have 11
a 6799
little 6
music 24
cried 1
Miss 71
tired 6
of 109
a 6799
conversation 8
in 2719
which 2
she 199
had 11
no 896
share 22
Louisa 2
you 29
will 39
not 85
mind 25
my 90
waking 2
Mr 5
Hurst 2
Her 181
sister 9
had 11
not 85
the 193
smallest 1
objection 5
and 51
the 193
pianoforte 3
was 93
opened 1
and 51
Darcy 2
after 48
a 6799
few 6
recollection 3
was 93
not 85
sorry 1
for 484
it 67
He 962
began 1
to 806
feel 11
the 193
danger 7
of 109
paying 1
Elizabeth 5
too 50
much 2
attention 3
Chapter 3
In 2719
consequence 3
of 109
an 970
agreement 3
between 1
the 193
sisters 1
Elizabeth 5
wrote 1
the 193
next 2
morning 3
to 806
their 2
mother 21
to 806
beg 59
that 11
the 193
carriage 5
might 9
be 1200
sent 35
for 484
them 9
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
the 193
day 27
But 82
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
who 79
had 11
calculated 2
on 86
her 181
daughters 1
remaining 1
at 272
till 14
the 193
following 3
Tuesday 3
which 2
would 5
exactly 1
finish 8
week 20
could 2
not 85
bring 6
herself 1
to 806
receive 8
them 9
with 34
pleasure 5
before 2
Her 181
answer 8
therefore 1
was 93
not 85
propitious 2
at 272
least 3
not 85
to 806
Elizabeth's 1
wishes 1
for 484
she 199
was 93
impatient 2
to 806
get 13
home 90
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
sent 35
them 9
word 26
that 11
they 5
could 2
not 85
possibly 1
have 11
the 193
carriage 5
before 2
Tuesday 3
and 51
in 2719
her 181
postscript 3
it 67
was 93
added 1
that 11
if 8
Mr 5
and 51
his 43
sister 9
pressed 1
them 9
to 806
stay 7
longer 1
she 199
could 2
spare 11
them 9
very 1
well 24
Against 1
staying 1
longer 1
however 1
Elizabeth 5
was 93
positively 1
did 23
she 199
much 2
expect 20
it 67
would 5
be 1200
asked 1
and 51
fearful 4
on 86
the 193
contrary 2
as 509
being 3
considered 1
as 509
intruding 1
themselves 1
needlessly 1
long 49
she 199
urged 1
Jane 8
to 806
borrow 9
Mr 5
carriage 5
immediately 1
and 51
at 272
length 14
it 67
was 93
settled 1
that 11
their 2
original 6
design 16
of 109
leaving 3
that 11
morning 3
should 7
be 1200
mentioned 1
and 51
the 193
request 6
made 13
The 193
communication 3
excited 2
many 2
professions 1
of 109
concern 6
and 51
enough 2
was 93
said 1
of 109
wishing 1
them 9
to 806
stay 7
at 272
least 3
till 14
the 193
following 3
day 27
to 806
work 87
on 86
Jane 8
and 51
till 14
the 193
morrow 3
their 2
going 3
was 93
deferred 1
Miss 71
was 93
then 5
sorry 1
that 11
she 199
had 11
proposed 1
the 193
delay 8
for 484
her 181
jealousy 2
and 51
dislike 4
of 109
one 19
sister 9
much 2
exceeded 1
her 181
affection 5
for 484
the 193
other 5
The 193
master 28
of 109
the 193
house 87
heard 1
with 34
real 47
sorrow 9
that 11
they 5
were 5
to 806
go 501
so 797
soon 3
and 51
repeatedly 1
tried 1
to 806
persuade 6
Miss 71
Bennet 1
that 11
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
safe 20
for 484
she 199
was 93
not 85
enough 2
recovered 1
but 82
Jane 8
was 93
firm 16
where 21
she 199
felt 5
herself 1
to 806
be 1200
right 31
To 806
Mr 5
Darcy 2
it 67
was 93
welcome 4
had 11
been 1
at 272
long 49
enough 2
She 199
attracted 1
him 9
more 11
than 22
he 962
Miss 71
was 93
uncivil 3
to 806
and 51
more 11
teasing 2
than 22
usual 3
to 806
himself 1
He 962
wisely 1
resolved 1
to 806
be 1200
particularly 1
careful 6
that 11
no 896
sign 70
of 109
admiration 2
should 7
escape 10
him 9
nothing 5
that 11
could 2
elevate 3
her 181
with 34
the 193
hope 16
of 109
influencing 1
his 43
felicity 2
sensible 3
that 11
if 8
such 2
an 970
idea 21
had 11
been 1
suggested 1
his 43
during 1
the 193
last 7
day 27
must 28
have 11
material 17
weight 21
in 2719
confirming 1
or 333
crushing 2
it 67
Steady 3
to 806
his 43
purpose 12
he 962
scarcely 1
spoke 14
ten 151
words 5
to 806
her 181
through 4
the 193
whole 26
of 109
Saturday 3
and 51
though 12
they 5
were 5
at 272
one 19
time 45
left 19
by 57
themselves 1
for 484
he 962
adhered 1
most 3
conscientiously 1
to 806
his 43
book 69
and 51
would 5
not 85
even 36
look 14
at 272
her 181
On 86
Sunday 3
after 48
morning 3
service 13
the 193
separation 3
so 797
agreeable 3
to 806
almost 1
all 162
took 1
place 29
Miss 71
civility 2
to 806
Elizabeth 5
increased 1
at 272
last 7
very 1
rapidly 1
as 509
well 24
as 509
her 181
affection 5
for 484
Jane 8
and 51
when 6
they 5
parted 1
after 48
assuring 1
the 193
latter 3
of 109
the 193
pleasure 5
it 67
would 5
always 1
give 15
her 181
to 806
see 70
her 181
either 1
at 272
or 333
and 51
embracing 1
her 181
most 3
tenderly 1
she 199
even 36
shook 1
hands 24
with 34
the 193
former 3
Elizabeth 5
took 1
leave 14
of 109
the 193
whole 26
party 3
in 2719
the 193
liveliest 1
of 109
spirits 1
They 5
were 5
not 85
welcomed 1
home 90
very 1
cordially 1
by 57
their 2
mother 21
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
wondered 1
at 272
their 2
coming 3
and 51
thought 11
them 9
very 1
wrong 24
to 806
give 15
so 797
much 2
trouble 18
and 51
was 93
sure 11
Jane 8
would 5
have 11
caught 1
cold 9
again 2
But 82
their 2
father 12
though 12
very 1
laconic 2
in 2719
his 43
expressions 1
of 109
pleasure 5
was 93
really 1
glad 30
to 806
see 70
them 9
he 962
had 11
felt 5
their 2
importance 2
in 2719
the 193
family 2
circle 7
The 193
evening 3
conversation 8
when 6
they 5
were 5
all 162
assembled 1
had 11
lost 1
much 2
of 109
its 2
animation 3
and 51
almost 1
all 162
its 2
sense 8
by 57
the 193
absence 3
of 109
Jane 8
and 51
Elizabeth 5
They 5
found 18
Mary 13
as 509
usual 3
deep 12
in 2719
the 193
study 3
of 109
and 51
human 41
nature 3
and 51
had 11
some 30
extracts 1
to 806
admire 6
and 51
some 30
new 115
observations 1
of 109
threadbare 1
morality 2
to 806
listen 9
to 806
Catherine 2
and 51
Lydia 4
had 11
information 3
for 484
them 9
of 109
a 6799
different 11
sort 14
Much 2
had 11
been 1
done 3
and 51
much 2
had 11
been 1
said 1
in 2719
the 193
regiment 8
since 7
the 193
preceding 1
Wednesday 3
several 3
of 109
the 193
officers 1
had 11
dined 1
lately 1
with 34
their 2
uncle 18
a 6799
private 9
had 11
been 1
flogged 1
and 51
it 67
had 11
actually 1
been 1
hinted 1
that 11
Colonel 5
Forster 1
was 93
going 3
to 806
be 1200
married 3
Chapter 3
I 4330
hope 16
my 90
dear 15
said 1
Mr 5
Bennet 1
to 806
his 43
wife 6
as 509
they 5
were 5
at 272
breakfast 5
the 193
next 2
morning 3
that 11
you 29
have 11
ordered 1
a 6799
good 29
dinner 9
because 1
I 4330
have 11
reason 13
to 806
expect 20
an 970
addition 5
to 806
our 3
family 2
party 3
Who 79
do 814
you 29
mean 36
my 90
dear 15
I 4330
know 12
of 109
nobody 2
that 11
is 124
coming 3
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
unless 1
Charlotte 4
Lucas 1
should 7
happen 9
to 806
call 57
I 4330
hope 16
dinners 1
are 12
good 29
enough 2
for 484
her 181
I 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
she 199
often 4
sees 6
such 2
at 272
home 90
The 193
person 33
of 109
whom 3
I 4330
speak 12
is 124
a 6799
gentleman 3
and 51
a 6799
stranger 3
Mrs 1
eyes 8
sparkled 1
A 6799
gentleman 3
and 51
a 6799
stranger 3
It 67
is 124
Mr 5
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
Well 24
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
I 4330
shall 12
be 1200
extremely 1
glad 30
to 806
see 70
Mr 5
Lord 13
how 27
unlucky 1
There 21
is 124
not 85
a 6799
bit 48
of 109
fish 46
to 806
be 1200
got 14
Lydia 4
my 90
love 29
ring 30
the 193
must 28
speak 12
to 806
Hill 22
this 6
moment 14
It 67
is 124
Mr 5
said 1
her 181
husband 10
it 67
is 124
a 6799
person 33
whom 3
I 4330
never 3
saw 24
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
course 10
of 109
my 90
life 44
This 6
roused 1
a 6799
general 22
astonishment 2
and 51
he 962
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
being 3
eagerly 1
questioned 1
by 57
his 43
wife 6
and 51
his 43
five 5
daughters 1
at 272
once 2
After 48
amusing 2
himself 1
some 30
time 45
with 34
their 2
curiosity 2
he 962
thus 1
explained 1
About 1
a 6799
month 6
ago 15
I 4330
received 1
this 6
letter 20
and 51
about 1
a 6799
fortnight 4
ago 15
I 4330
answered 1
it 67
for 484
I 4330
thought 11
it 67
a 6799
case 25
of 109
some 30
delicacy 2
and 51
requiring 1
early 1
attention 3
It 67
is 124
from 2
my 90
cousin 3
Mr 5
Collins 1
who 79
when 6
I 4330
am 392
dead 39
may 49
turn 46
you 29
all 162
out 365
of 109
this 6
house 87
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 962
pleases 1
Oh 17
my 90
dear 15
cried 1
his 43
wife 6
I 4330
cannot 1
bear 30
to 806
hear 76
that 11
mentioned 1
Pray 9
do 814
not 85
talk 18
of 109
that 11
odious 4
man 343
I 4330
do 814
think 8
it 67
is 124
the 193
hardest 1
thing 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
that 11
your 4
estate 3
should 7
be 1200
entailed 1
away 1
from 2
your 4
own 9
children 1
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
if 8
I 4330
had 11
been 1
you 29
I 4330
should 7
have 11
tried 1
long 49
ago 15
to 806
do 814
something 3
or 333
other 5
about 1
it 67
Jane 8
and 51
Elizabeth 5
tried 1
to 806
explain 5
to 806
her 181
the 193
nature 3
of 109
an 970
entail 6
They 5
had 11
often 4
attempted 1
to 806
do 814
it 67
before 2
but 82
it 67
was 93
a 6799
subject 11
on 86
which 2
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
was 93
beyond 1
the 193
reach 6
of 109
reason 13
and 51
she 199
continued 1
to 806
rail 26
bitterly 1
against 1
the 193
cruelty 2
of 109
settling 1
an 970
estate 3
away 1
from 2
a 6799
family 2
of 109
five 5
daughters 1
in 2719
of 109
a 6799
man 343
whom 3
nobody 2
cared 1
anything 3
about 1
It 67
certainly 1
is 124
a 6799
most 3
iniquitous 2
affair 3
said 1
Mr 5
Bennet 1
and 51
nothing 5
can 287
clear 23
Mr 5
Collins 1
from 2
the 193
guilt 9
of 109
inheriting 1
But 82
if 8
you 29
will 39
listen 9
to 806
his 43
letter 20
you 29
may 49
perhaps 1
be 1200
a 6799
little 6
softened 1
by 57
his 43
manner 8
of 109
expressing 1
himself 1
No 896
that 11
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
and 51
I 4330
think 8
it 67
is 124
very 1
impertinent 2
of 109
him 9
to 806
write 5
to 806
you 29
at 272
all 162
and 51
very 1
hypocritical 2
I 4330
hate 14
such 2
false 12
friends 4
Why 4
could 2
he 962
not 85
keep 11
on 86
quarreling 1
with 34
you 29
as 509
his 43
father 12
did 23
before 2
him 9
Why 4
indeed 1
he 962
does 5
seem 10
to 806
have 11
had 11
some 30
filial 1
scruples 1
on 86
that 11
head 140
as 509
you 29
will 39
hear 76
near 15
Kent 9
Dear 15
Sir 22
The 193
disagreement 3
subsisting 1
between 1
yourself 1
and 51
my 90
late 23
father 12
always 1
gave 4
me 1041
much 2
uneasiness 2
and 51
since 7
I 4330
have 11
had 11
the 193
misfortune 3
to 806
lose 5
him 9
I 4330
have 11
frequently 1
wished 1
to 806
heal 19
the 193
breach 5
but 82
for 484
some 30
time 45
I 4330
was 93
kept 1
back 182
by 57
my 90
own 9
doubts 1
fearing 1
lest 5
it 67
might 9
seem 10
disrespectful 2
to 806
his 43
memory 2
for 484
me 1041
to 806
be 1200
on 86
good 29
terms 1
with 34
anyone 2
with 34
whom 3
it 67
had 11
always 1
pleased 1
him 9
to 806
be 1200
at 272
variance 3
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
mind 25
however 1
is 124
now 10
made 13
up 194
on 86
the 193
subject 11
for 484
having 1
received 1
ordination 3
at 272
Easter 11
I 4330
have 11
been 1
so 797
fortunate 2
as 509
to 806
be 1200
distinguished 1
by 57
the 193
patronage 3
of 109
the 193
Right 31
Lady 18
Catherine 2
de 2452
widow 10
of 109
Sir 22
Lewis 1
de 2452
whose 1
bounty 2
and 51
beneficence 2
has 41
preferred 1
me 1041
to 806
the 193
valuable 3
rectory 2
of 109
this 6
parish 6
where 21
it 67
shall 12
be 1200
my 90
earnest 8
to 806
demean 6
myself 1
with 34
grateful 4
respect 18
towards 1
her 181
ladyship 3
and 51
be 1200
ever 33
ready 2
to 806
perform 10
those 1
rites 1
and 51
ceremonies 1
which 2
are 12
instituted 1
by 57
the 193
Church 21
of 109
England 2
As 509
a 6799
clergyman 2
moreover 1
I 4330
feel 11
it 67
my 90
duty 2
to 806
promote 6
and 51
establish 7
the 193
blessing 3
of 109
peace 21
in 2719
all 162
families 1
within 3
the 193
reach 6
of 109
my 90
influence 4
and 51
on 86
these 4
grounds 10
I 4330
flatter 10
myself 1
that 11
my 90
present 20
overtures 1
are 12
highly 1
commendable 1
and 51
that 11
the 193
circumstance 4
of 109
my 90
being 3
next 2
in 2719
the 193
entail 6
of 109
estate 3
will 39
be 1200
kindly 1
overlooked 1
on 86
your 4
side 74
and 51
not 85
lead 15
you 29
to 806
reject 8
the 193
offered 1
I 4330
cannot 1
be 1200
otherwise 1
than 22
concerned 2
at 272
being 3
the 193
means 1
of 109
injuring 1
your 4
amiable 1
daughters 1
and 51
beg 59
leave 14
to 806
for 484
it 67
as 509
well 24
as 509
to 806
assure 6
you 29
of 109
my 90
readiness 2
to 806
make 17
them 9
every 10
possible 3
of 109
this 6
hereafter 3
If 8
you 29
should 7
have 11
no 896
objection 5
to 806
receive 8
me 1041
into 26
your 4
house 87
I 4330
propose 6
myself 1
the 193
satisfaction 3
of 109
waiting 2
on 86
you 29
and 51
your 4
family 2
Monday 3
November 3
th 737
by 57
four 26
o'clock 1
and 51
shall 12
probably 1
trespass 8
on 86
your 4
hospitality 2
till 14
the 193
Saturday 3
following 3
which 2
I 4330
can 287
do 814
without 1
any 17
inconvenience 4
as 509
Lady 18
Catherine 2
is 124
far 91
from 2
objecting 1
to 806
my 90
occasional 2
absence 3
on 86
a 6799
Sunday 3
provided 1
that 11
some 30
other 5
clergyman 2
is 124
engaged 1
to 806
do 814
the 193
duty 2
of 109
the 193
day 27
remain 9
dear 15
sir 22
with 34
respectful 4
compliments 1
to 806
your 4
lady 18
and 51
daughters 1
your 4
and 51
friend 14
WILLIAM 3
COLLINS 1
At 272
four 26
o'clock 1
therefore 1
we 444
may 49
expect 20
this 6
gentleman 3
said 1
Mr 5
Bennet 1
as 509
he 962
folded 1
up 194
the 193
letter 20
He 962
seems 1
to 806
be 1200
a 6799
most 3
conscientious 4
and 51
polite 8
young 9
man 343
upon 1
my 90
word 26
and 51
I 4330
doubt 15
not 85
will 39
prove 21
a 6799
valuable 3
acquaintance 5
especially 1
if 8
Lady 18
Catherine 2
should 7
be 1200
so 797
indulgent 2
as 509
to 806
let 50
him 9
come 36
to 806
us 70
again 2
There 21
is 124
some 30
sense 8
in 2719
what 14
he 962
says 1
about 1
the 193
girls 1
however 1
and 51
if 8
he 962
is 124
disposed 1
to 806
make 17
them 9
any 17
amends 1
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
be 1200
the 193
person 33
to 806
discourage 6
him 9
Though 12
it 67
is 124
difficult 5
said 1
Jane 8
to 806
guess 16
in 2719
what 14
way 27
he 962
can 287
mean 36
to 806
make 17
us 70
the 193
atonement 2
he 962
thinks 1
our 3
due 21
the 193
wish 13
is 124
certainly 1
to 806
his 43
credit 12
Elizabeth 5
was 93
chiefly 1
struck 1
by 57
his 43
extraordinary 1
deference 2
for 484
Lady 18
Catherine 2
and 51
his 43
kind 31
intention 5
of 109
christening 3
marrying 1
and 51
burying 1
his 43
parishioners 1
whenever 1
it 67
were 5
required 1
He 962
must 28
be 1200
an 970
oddity 2
I 4330
think 8
said 1
she 199
I 4330
cannot 1
make 17
him 9
out 365
is 124
something 3
very 1
pompous 4
in 2719
his 43
style 4
what 14
can 287
he 962
mean 36
by 57
for 484
being 3
next 2
in 2719
the 193
entail 6
cannot 1
suppose 4
he 962
would 5
help 23
it 67
if 8
he 962
could 2
he 962
be 1200
a 6799
sensible 3
man 343
sir 22
No 896
my 90
dear 15
I 4330
think 8
not 85
I 4330
have 11
great 12
hopes 1
of 109
finding 4
him 9
quite 1
the 193
reverse 5
There 21
is 124
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
servility 2
and 51
in 2719
his 43
letter 20
which 2
promises 1
well 24
I 4330
am 392
impatient 2
to 806
see 70
him 9
In 2719
point 22
of 109
composition 3
said 1
Mary 13
the 193
letter 20
does 5
not 85
seem 10
defective 6
The 193
idea 21
of 109
the 193
perhaps 1
is 124
not 85
wholly 1
new 115
yet 4
I 4330
think 8
it 67
is 124
well 24
expressed 1
To 806
Catherine 2
and 51
Lydia 4
neither 1
the 193
letter 20
nor 102
its 2
writer 3
were 5
in 2719
any 17
degree 3
interesting 2
It 67
was 93
next 2
to 806
impossible 2
that 11
their 2
cousin 3
should 7
come 36
in 2719
a 6799
scarlet 2
coat 12
and 51
it 67
was 93
now 10
some 30
weeks 2
since 7
they 5
had 11
received 1
pleasure 5
from 2
the 193
society 2
of 109
a 6799
man 343
in 2719
any 17
other 5
As 509
for 484
their 2
mother 21
Mr 5
letter 20
had 11
done 3
away 1
much 2
of 109
her 181
and 51
she 199
was 93
preparing 1
to 806
see 70
him 9
with 34
a 6799
degree 3
of 109
composure 2
which 2
astonished 1
her 181
husband 10
and 51
daughters 1
Mr 5
Collins 1
was 93
punctual 4
to 806
his 43
time 45
and 51
was 93
received 1
with 34
great 12
politeness 2
by 57
the 193
whole 26
family 2
Mr 5
Bennet 1
indeed 1
said 1
little 6
but 82
the 193
ladies 1
were 5
ready 2
enough 2
to 806
talk 18
and 51
Mr 5
Collins 1
seemed 1
neither 1
in 2719
need 29
of 109
encouragement 3
nor 102
inclined 1
to 806
be 1200
silent 6
himself 1
He 962
was 93
a 6799
tall 35
young 9
man 343
of 109
His 43
air 129
was 93
grave 28
and 51
stately 1
and 51
his 43
manners 1
were 5
very 1
formal 21
He 962
had 11
not 85
been 1
long 49
seated 1
before 2
he 962
complimented 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
on 86
having 1
so 797
fine 17
a 6799
family 2
of 109
daughters 1
said 1
he 962
had 11
heard 1
much 2
of 109
their 2
beauty 2
but 82
that 11
in 2719
this 6
instance 4
fame 3
had 11
fallen 1
short 62
of 109
the 193
truth 7
and 51
added 1
that 11
he 962
did 23
not 85
doubt 15
her 181
seeing 2
them 9
all 162
in 2719
due 21
time 45
disposed 1
of 109
in 2719
marriage 6
This 6
gallantry 2
was 93
not 85
much 2
to 806
the 193
taste 15
of 109
some 30
of 109
his 43
hearers 1
but 82
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
who 79
quarreled 1
with 34
no 896
compliments 1
answered 1
most 3
readily 1
You 29
are 12
very 1
kind 31
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
and 51
I 4330
wish 13
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
it 67
may 49
prove 21
so 797
for 484
else 2
they 5
will 39
be 1200
destitute 1
enough 2
Things 1
are 12
settled 1
so 797
oddly 1
You 29
allude 3
perhaps 1
to 806
the 193
entail 6
of 109
this 6
estate 3
Ah 17
sir 22
I 4330
do 814
indeed 1
It 67
is 124
a 6799
grievous 4
affair 3
to 806
my 90
poor 11
girls 1
you 29
must 28
confess 14
Not 85
that 11
I 4330
mean 36
to 806
find 10
fault 20
with 34
_you_ 1
for 484
such 2
things 1
I 4330
know 12
are 12
all 162
chance 20
in 2719
this 6
world 12
There 21
is 124
no 896
knowing 3
how 27
estates 1
will 39
go 501
when 6
once 2
they 5
come 36
to 806
be 1200
entailed 1
I 4330
am 392
very 1
sensible 3
madam 5
of 109
the 193
hardship 3
to 806
my 90
fair 25
cousins 1
and 51
could 2
say 7
much 2
on 86
the 193
subject 11
but 82
that 11
I 4330
am 392
cautious 4
of 109
appearing 1
forward 12
and 51
precipitate 5
But 82
I 4330
can 287
assure 6
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
that 11
I 4330
come 36
prepared 3
to 806
admire 6
them 9
At 272
present 20
I 4330
will 39
not 85
say 7
more 11
but 82
perhaps 1
when 6
we 444
are 12
better 7
He 962
was 93
interrupted 1
by 57
a 6799
summons 5
to 806
dinner 9
and 51
the 193
girls 1
smiled 1
on 86
each 1
other 5
They 5
were 5
not 85
the 193
only 1
objects 1
of 109
Mr 5
admiration 2
The 193
hall 45
the 193
and 51
all 162
its 2
furniture 2
were 5
examined 1
and 51
praised 1
and 51
his 43
commendation 3
of 109
everything 2
would 5
have 11
touched 1
Mrs 1
heart 57
but 82
for 484
the 193
mortifying 1
supposition 3
of 109
his 43
viewing 3
it 67
all 162
as 509
his 43
own 9
future 3
property 2
The 193
dinner 9
too 50
in 2719
its 2
turn 46
was 93
highly 1
admired 1
and 51
he 962
begged 1
to 806
know 12
to 806
which 2
of 109
his 43
fair 25
cousins 1
the 193
excellency 2
of 109
its 2
cooking 2
was 93
owing 1
But 82
he 962
was 93
set 40
right 31
there 21
by 57
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
who 79
assured 4
him 9
with 34
some 30
asperity 2
that 11
they 5
were 5
very 1
well 24
able 3
to 806
keep 11
a 6799
good 29
cook 28
and 51
that 11
her 181
daughters 1
had 11
nothing 5
to 806
do 814
in 2719
the 193
kitchen 9
He 962
begged 1
pardon 10
for 484
having 1
displeased 1
her 181
In 2719
a 6799
softened 1
tone 12
she 199
declared 1
herself 1
not 85
at 272
all 162
offended 1
but 82
he 962
continued 1
to 806
for 484
about 1
a 6799
quarter 25
of 109
an 970
hour 10
Chapter 3
During 1
dinner 9
Mr 5
Bennet 1
scarcely 1
spoke 14
at 272
all 162
but 82
when 6
the 193
servants 1
were 5
withdrawn 1
he 962
thought 11
it 67
time 45
to 806
have 11
some 30
conversation 8
with 34
his 43
guest 9
and 51
therefore 1
started 1
a 6799
subject 11
in 2719
which 2
he 962
expected 1
him 9
to 806
shine 7
by 57
observing 1
that 11
he 962
seemed 1
very 1
fortunate 2
in 2719
his 43
patroness 3
Lady 18
Catherine 2
de 2452
attention 3
to 806
his 43
wishes 1
and 51
consideration 3
for 484
his 43
comfort 14
appeared 1
very 1
remarkable 3
Mr 5
Bennet 1
could 2
not 85
have 11
chosen 1
better 7
Mr 5
Collins 1
was 93
eloquent 2
in 2719
her 181
praise 7
The 193
subject 11
elevated 1
him 9
to 806
more 11
than 22
usual 3
solemnity 2
of 109
manner 8
and 51
with 34
a 6799
most 3
important 2
aspect 3
he 962
protested 1
that 11
he 962
had 11
never 3
in 2719
his 43
life 44
witnessed 1
such 2
in 2719
a 6799
person 33
of 109
affability 2
and 51
condescension 2
as 509
he 962
had 11
himself 1
experienced 1
from 2
Lady 18
Catherine 2
She 199
had 11
been 1
graciously 1
pleased 1
to 806
approve 3
of 109
both 8
of 109
the 193
discourses 1
which 2
he 962
had 11
already 1
had 11
the 193
of 109
preaching 1
before 2
her 181
She 199
had 11
also 3
asked 1
him 9
twice 1
to 806
dine 9
at 272
and 51
had 11
sent 35
for 484
him 9
only 1
the 193
Saturday 3
before 2
to 806
make 17
up 194
her 181
pool 12
of 109
quadrille 3
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
Lady 18
Catherine 2
was 93
reckoned 1
proud 5
by 57
many 2
people 4
he 962
knew 1
but 82
had 11
never 3
seen 1
anything 3
but 82
affability 2
in 2719
her 181
She 199
had 11
always 1
spoken 1
to 806
him 9
as 509
she 199
would 5
to 806
any 17
other 5
gentleman 3
she 199
made 13
not 85
the 193
smallest 1
objection 5
to 806
his 43
joining 1
in 2719
the 193
society 2
of 109
the 193
nor 102
to 806
his 43
leaving 3
the 193
parish 6
occasionally 1
for 484
a 6799
week 20
or 333
two 14
to 806
visit 14
his 43
relations 4
She 199
had 11
even 36
condescended 1
to 806
advise 9
him 9
to 806
marry 2
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 962
could 2
provided 1
he 962
chose 2
with 34
discretion 3
and 51
had 11
once 2
paid 1
him 9
a 6799
visit 14
in 2719
his 43
humble 9
parsonage 3
where 21
she 199
had 11
perfectly 1
approved 1
all 162
the 193
alterations 1
he 962
had 11
been 1
making 4
and 51
had 11
even 36
vouchsafed 1
to 806
suggest 15
some 30
shelves 1
in 2719
the 193
closet 5
up 194
stairs 1
That 11
is 124
all 162
very 1
proper 9
and 51
civil 15
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
said 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
and 51
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
she 199
is 124
a 6799
very 1
agreeable 3
woman 21
It 67
is 124
a 6799
pity 4
that 11
great 12
ladies 1
in 2719
general 22
are 12
not 85
more 11
like 22
her 181
Does 5
she 199
live 43
near 15
you 29
sir 22
The 193
garden 12
in 2719
which 2
stands 4
my 90
humble 9
abode 3
is 124
separated 1
only 1
by 57
a 6799
lane 3
from 2
Park 18
her 181
ladyship's 1
residence 3
I 4330
think 8
you 29
said 1
she 199
was 93
a 6799
widow 10
sir 22
Has 41
she 199
any 17
family 2
She 199
has 41
only 1
one 19
daughter 4
the 193
heiress 3
of 109
and 51
of 109
very 1
extensive 4
property 2
Ah 17
said 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
shaking 1
her 181
head 140
then 5
she 199
is 124
better 7
off 100
than 22
many 2
girls 1
And 51
what 14
sort 14
of 109
young 9
lady 18
is 124
she 199
Is 124
she 199
handsome 6
She 199
is 124
a 6799
most 3
charming 2
young 9
lady 18
indeed 1
Lady 18
Catherine 2
herself 1
says 1
that 11
in 2719
point 22
of 109
true 9
beauty 2
Miss 71
de 2452
is 124
far 91
superior 5
to 806
the 193
handsomest 1
of 109
her 181
sex 45
because 1
there 21
is 124
that 11
in 2719
her 181
features 1
which 2
marks 6
the 193
young 9
lady 18
of 109
distinguished 1
birth 23
She 199
is 124
unfortunately 1
of 109
a 6799
sickly 1
constitution 10
which 2
has 41
prevented 1
her 181
from 2
making 4
that 11
progress 14
in 2719
many 2
accomplishments 1
which 2
she 199
could 2
not 85
have 11
otherwise 1
failed 1
of 109
as 509
I 4330
am 392
informed 1
by 57
the 193
lady 18
who 79
superintended 1
her 181
education 9
and 51
who 79
still 13
resides 1
with 34
them 9
But 82
she 199
is 124
perfectly 1
amiable 1
and 51
often 4
condescends 1
to 806
drive 18
by 57
my 90
humble 9
abode 3
in 2719
her 181
little 6
phaeton 3
and 51
ponies 1
Has 41
she 199
been 1
presented 1
I 4330
do 814
not 85
remember 4
her 181
name 17
among 1
the 193
ladies 1
at 272
court 37
Her 181
indifferent 2
state 41
of 109
health 12
unhappily 1
prevents 1
her 181
being 3
in 2719
town 27
and 51
by 57
that 11
means 1
as 509
I 4330
told 1
Lady 18
Catherine 2
one 19
day 27
has 41
deprived 1
the 193
British 5
court 37
of 109
its 2
brightest 1
ornament 8
Her 181
ladyship 3
seemed 1
pleased 1
with 34
the 193
idea 21
and 51
you 29
may 49
imagine 3
that 11
I 4330
am 392
happy 1
on 86
every 10
occasion 7
to 806
offer 10
those 1
little 6
delicate 7
compliments 1
which 2
are 12
always 1
acceptable 3
to 806
ladies 1
I 4330
have 11
more 11
than 22
once 2
observed 1
to 806
Lady 18
Catherine 2
that 11
her 181
charming 2
daughter 4
seemed 1
born 4
to 806
be 1200
a 6799
duchess 3
and 51
that 11
the 193
most 3
elevated 1
rank 19
instead 1
of 109
giving 2
her 181
consequence 3
would 5
be 1200
adorned 1
by 57
her 181
These 4
are 12
the 193
kind 31
of 109
little 6
things 1
which 2
please 3
her 181
ladyship 3
and 51
it 67
is 124
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
attention 3
which 2
I 4330
conceive 3
myself 1
peculiarly 1
bound 16
to 806
pay 52
You 29
judge 6
very 1
properly 1
said 1
Mr 5
Bennet 1
and 51
it 67
is 124
happy 1
for 484
you 29
that 11
you 29
possess 16
the 193
talent 4
of 109
flattering 2
with 34
delicacy 2
May 49
I 4330
ask 6
whether 1
these 4
pleasing 3
attentions 1
proceed 7
from 2
the 193
impulse 4
of 109
the 193
moment 14
or 333
are 12
the 193
result 8
of 109
previous 2
study 3
They 5
arise 3
chiefly 1
from 2
what 14
is 124
passing 3
at 272
the 193
time 45
and 51
though 12
I 4330
sometimes 1
amuse 6
myself 1
with 34
suggesting 1
and 51
arranging 1
such 2
little 6
elegant 2
compliments 1
as 509
may 49
be 1200
adapted 1
to 806
ordinary 2
occasions 1
I 4330
always 1
wish 13
to 806
give 15
them 9
as 509
unstudied 1
an 970
air 129
as 509
possible 3
Mr 5
expectations 1
were 5
fully 1
answered 1
His 43
cousin 3
was 93
as 509
absurd 9
as 509
he 962
had 11
hoped 1
and 51
he 962
listened 1
to 806
him 9
with 34
the 193
keenest 1
enjoyment 3
maintaining 1
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
the 193
most 3
resolute 4
composure 2
of 109
countenance 4
and 51
except 10
in 2719
an 970
occasional 2
glance 4
at 272
Elizabeth 5
requiring 1
no 896
partner 8
in 2719
his 43
pleasure 5
By 57
however 1
the 193
dose 4
had 11
been 1
enough 2
and 51
Mr 5
Bennet 1
was 93
glad 30
to 806
take 18
his 43
guest 9
into 26
the 193
again 2
and 51
when 6
tea 99
was 93
over 596
glad 30
to 806
invite 7
him 9
to 806
read 49
aloud 1
to 806
the 193
ladies 1
Mr 5
Collins 1
readily 1
assented 1
and 51
a 6799
book 69
was 93
produced 1
but 82
on 86
beholding 1
it 67
for 484
everything 2
announced 1
it 67
to 806
be 1200
from 2
a 6799
circulating 1
library 2
he 962
started 1
back 182
and 51
begging 1
pardon 10
protested 1
that 11
he 962
never 3
read 49
novels 1
Kitty 2
stared 1
at 272
him 9
and 51
Lydia 4
exclaimed 1
Other 5
books 15
were 5
produced 1
and 51
after 48
some 30
deliberation 3
he 962
chose 2
Sermons 1
Lydia 4
gaped 1
as 509
he 962
opened 1
the 193
volume 3
and 51
before 2
he 962
had 11
with 34
very 1
monotonous 4
solemnity 2
read 49
three 12
pages 1
she 199
interrupted 1
him 9
with 34
Do 814
you 29
know 12
mamma 9
that 11
my 90
uncle 18
Phillips 1
talks 1
of 109
turning 3
away 1
Richard 3
and 51
if 8
he 962
does 5
Colonel 5
Forster 1
will 39
hire 7
him 9
My 90
aunt 6
told 1
me 1041
so 797
herself 1
on 86
Saturday 3
I 4330
shall 12
walk 25
to 806
to-morrow 1
to 806
hear 76
more 11
about 1
it 67
and 51
to 806
ask 6
when 6
Mr 5
Denny 2
comes 4
back 182
from 2
town 27
Lydia 4
was 93
bid 24
by 57
her 181
two 14
eldest 1
sisters 1
to 806
hold 22
her 181
tongue 5
but 82
Mr 5
Collins 1
much 2
offended 1
laid 1
aside 3
his 43
book 69
and 51
said 1
I 4330
have 11
often 4
observed 1
how 27
little 6
young 9
ladies 1
are 12
interested 1
by 57
books 15
of 109
a 6799
serious 4
stamp 13
though 12
written 1
solely 1
for 484
their 2
benefit 5
It 67
amazes 1
me 1041
I 4330
confess 14
for 484
certainly 1
there 21
can 287
be 1200
nothing 5
so 797
advantageous 2
to 806
them 9
as 509
instruction 4
But 82
I 4330
will 39
no 896
longer 1
importune 3
my 90
young 9
cousin 3
Then 5
turning 3
to 806
Mr 5
Bennet 1
he 962
offered 1
himself 1
as 509
his 43
antagonist 5
at 272
backgammon 2
Mr 5
Bennet 1
accepted 1
the 193
challenge 7
observing 1
that 11
he 962
acted 1
very 1
wisely 1
in 2719
leaving 3
the 193
girls 1
to 806
their 2
own 9
trifling 1
amusements 1
Mrs 1
Bennet 1
and 51
her 181
daughters 1
most 3
civilly 1
for 484
interruption 3
and 51
promised 1
that 11
it 67
should 7
not 85
occur 7
again 2
if 8
he 962
would 5
resume 4
his 43
book 69
but 82
Mr 5
Collins 1
after 48
assuring 1
them 9
that 11
he 962
bore 13
his 43
young 9
cousin 3
no 896
and 51
should 7
never 3
resent 11
her 181
as 509
any 17
affront 5
seated 1
himself 1
at 272
another 1
table 27
with 34
Mr 5
Bennet 1
and 51
prepared 3
for 484
backgammon 2
